<p>That railway travel is not, as a rule, conducive to serious thought,
may fairly be inferred from the class of literature displayed on the
bookstalls at the stations.&nbsp; I have therefore refrained from any
attempt to excite the reflective faculties of the reader, excepting
in the first and third of the accompanying sketches, and even in these
have only ventured to suggest ideas, the full scope and pregnancy of
which it must be left to his own idiosyncrasy to appreciate and develop,
the more especially as they bear upon a certain current of investigation
which has recently become popular.</p>
<p>I have to express my thanks to the Editor of the &lsquo;Nineteenth
Century Review&rsquo; for the <!-- page vi--><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>kind
permission he has granted me to reproduce &ldquo;The Sisters of Thibet&rdquo;;
and I avail myself of the opportunity thus afforded of removing the
impression which, to my surprise, was conveyed to me by letters from
numerous correspondents, that the article contained any record of my
own personal experiences.&nbsp; The satire was suggested by the work
of an author whose sincerity I do not doubt, and for whose motives I
have the highest respect, in order to point out what appears to me the
defective morality, from an altruistic and practical point of view,
of a system of which he is the principal exponent in this country, and
which, under the name of Esoteric Buddhism, still seems to possess some
fascination for a certain class of minds.</p>
<p>The other articles originally appeared in &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;s
Magazine,&rsquo; and I wish to express my acknowledgments to my publishers
for their usual courtesy in allowing me to republish them in this form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A London Drawing-room</i>.
<span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;5 <i>o&rsquo;clock</i> <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>
<p><i>The afternoon tea apparatus in one corner of the room</i>, <i>and</i>
Lady Fritterly <i>on a couch in another</i>.&nbsp; The Hon. Mrs Allmash
<i>is announced</i>.</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; How too kind, dear, of you to come,
and so early, too!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got such a lot of interesting people
coming, and we are going to discuss the religion of the future.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; How quite delightful!&nbsp; I do so long
for something more substantial than the theologies of the past!&nbsp;
It is becoming quite puzzling to know what to teach one&rsquo;s children:
mine are getting old enough now to understand about things, and one
ought to teach them something.&nbsp; I was talking <!-- page 2--><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>about
it to that charming Professor Germsell last night.</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; Well, I hope he is coming presently,
so you will be able to continue your conversation.&nbsp; Then there
is Mr Coldwaite, the celebrated Comtist; and Mr Fussle, who writes those
delightful articles on prehistoric &aelig;sthetic evolution; and Mr
Drygull, the eminent theosophist, whose stories about esoteric Buddhism
are quite too extraordinary, and who has promised to bring a Khoja&mdash;a
most interesting moral specimen, my dear&mdash;who has just arrived
from Bombay; and Lord Fondleton.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; Lord Fondleton!&nbsp; I did not know that
he was interested in such subjects.</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; He says he is, dear; between ourselves&mdash;but
this, of course, is strictly <i>entre nous</i>&mdash;I rather think
that it is I who interest him: but I encourage him, poor fellow; it
may wean him from the unprofitable life he is leading, and turn his
mind to higher things.&nbsp; Oh! I almost forgot,&mdash;-then there
is my new beauty!</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; Your new beauty!</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; Yes; if you could only have dined with
me the other night, you <!-- page 3--><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>would
have met her.&nbsp; I had such a perfect little dinner.&nbsp; Just think!&nbsp;
A poet, an actor, a journalist, a painter, a wit, and a new beauty.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll tell you how I found her.&nbsp; She really belongs at present
to Lady Islington and myself; but of course, now we have started her,
all the other people will snap her up.&nbsp; We found that we both owed
that vulgar upstart, Mrs Houndsley, a visit, and went there together&mdash;because
I always think two people are less easily bored than one&mdash;when
suddenly the most perfect apparition you ever beheld stood before us;&mdash;an
old master dress, an immense pattern, a large hat rim encircling a face,
some rich auburn hair inside, and the face a perfect one.&nbsp; Well,
you know, it turned out that she was not born in the purple&mdash;her
husband is just a clerk in Burley&rsquo;s Bank; but we both insisted
on being introduced to her&mdash;for, you see, my dear, there is no
doubt about it, she is a ready-made beauty.&nbsp; The same idea occurred
to Lady Islington, so we agreed as we drove away that we would bring
her out.&nbsp; The result is, that she went to Islington House on Tuesday,
and came to me on Thursday, and created a perfect furor on both occasions;
so now she is fairly started.</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp;
How wonderfully clever and fortunate you are, dear!&nbsp; What is her
name?</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; Mrs Gloring.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; Oh yes; everybody was talking about her
at the Duchess&rsquo;s last night.&nbsp; I am dying to see her; but
they say that she is rather a fool.</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; Pure spite and jealousy.&nbsp; Yet that
is the way these Christian women of society obey the precept of their
religion, and love their neighbours as themselves.</p>
<p>[Lord Fondleton <i>is announced</i>, <i>accompanied by a stranger</i>.</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i>.&nbsp; How d&rsquo;ye do, Lady Fritterly?&nbsp;
I am sure you will excuse my taking the liberty of introducing Mr Rollestone,
a very old friend of mine, to you; he has only just returned to England,
after an absence of so many years that he is quite a stranger in London.</p>
<p>[Lady Fritterly <i>is</i> &ldquo;<i>delighted</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>The
rest of the party arrive in rapid succession</i>.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; Dear Mr Germsell, I was just telling Lady
Fritterly what an interesting conversation we were having last night
when <!-- page 5--><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>it was unfortunately
interrupted.&nbsp; I shall be so glad if you would explain more fully
now what you were telling me.&nbsp; I am sure everybody would be interested.</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; Oh do, Mr Germsell; it would be quite
too nice of you.&nbsp; And, Mr Drygull, will you ask the Khoja to&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mr Drygull</i>.&nbsp; My friend&rsquo;s name is Ali Seyyid, Lady
Fritterly.</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; Pray excuse my stupidity, Mr Allyside,
and come and sit near me.&nbsp; Lord Fondleton, find Mrs Gloring a chair.</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i> [<i>aside to</i> Mrs Gloring].&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s
our black friend?</p>
<p><i>Mrs Gloring</i>.&nbsp; I am sure I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I think
Lady Fritterly called him a codger.</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i>.&nbsp; Ah, he looks like it,&mdash;and a rum
one at that, as our American cousins say.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Gloring</i>.&nbsp; Hush!&nbsp; Mr Germsell is going to begin.</p>
<p><i>Mr Germsell</i>.&nbsp; Mrs Allmash asked me last night whether
my thoughts had been directed to the topic which is uppermost just now
in so many minds in regard to the religion of the future, and I ventured
to tell her that it would be found to be contained in the generalised
expediency of the past.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span><i>Mr Fussle</i>.&nbsp;
Pardon me, but the religion of the future must be the result of an evolutionary
process, and I don&rsquo;t see how generalisations of past expediency
are to help the evolution of humanity.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; They throw light upon it; and the study of
the evolutionary process so far teaches us how we may evolve in the
future.&nbsp; For instance, you have only got to think of evolution
as divided into moral, astronomic, geologic, biologic, psychologic,
sociologic, &aelig;sthetic, and so forth, and you will find that there
is always an evolution of the parts into which it divides itself, and
that therefore there is but one evolution going on everywhere after
the same manner.&nbsp; The work of science has been not to extend our
experience, for that is impossible, but to systematise it; and in that
systematisation of it will be found the religion of which we are in
search.</p>
<p><i>Drygull</i>.&nbsp; May I ask why you deem it impossible that our
experience can be extended?</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; Because it has itself defined its limits.&nbsp;
The combined experience of humanity, so far as its earliest records
go, has been limited by laws, the nature of which <!-- page 7--><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>have
been ascertained: it is impossible that it should be transcended without
violation of the conclusions arrived at by positive science.</p>
<p><i>Drygull</i>.&nbsp; I can more easily understand that the conclusions
arrived at by men of science should be limited, than that the experience
of humanity should be confined by those conclusions; but I fail to perceive
why those philosophers should deny the existence of certain human faculties,
because they don&rsquo;t happen to possess them themselves.&nbsp; I
think I know a Rishi who can produce experiences which would scatter
all their conclusions to the winds, when the whole system which is built
upon them would collapse.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Gloring</i> [<i>aside to</i> Lord Fondleton].&nbsp; Pray,
Lord Fondleton, can you tell me what a Rishi is?</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i>.&nbsp; A man who has got into higher states,
you know&mdash;what I heard Mr Drygull call a transcendentalist the
other day, whatever that may be.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand much
about these matters myself, but I take it he is a sort of evolved codger.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; Oh, how awfully interesting!&nbsp; Dear
Mr Drygull, do tell us some of the extraordinary things the Rishi can
do.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span><i>Drygull</i>.&nbsp;
If you will only all of you listen attentively, and if Mr Germsell will
have the goodness to modify to some degree the prejudiced attitude of
mind common to all men of science, you will hear him as plainly as I
can at this moment beating a tom-tom in his cottage in the Himalayas.</p>
<p>[Mr Germsell <i>gets up impatiently</i>, <i>and walks to the other
end of the back drawing-room</i>.</p>
<p><i>Drygull</i> [<i>casting a compassionate glance after him</i>].&nbsp;
Perhaps it is better so.&nbsp; Now please, Lady Fritterly, I must request
a few moments of the most profound silence on the part of all.&nbsp;
You will not hear the sound as though coming from a distance, but it
will seem rather like a muffled drumming taking place inside your head,
scarcely perceptible at first, when its volume will gradually increase.</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i> [<i>aside to</i> Mrs Gloring].&nbsp; Some bad
champagne produced the same phenomenon in my head last night.</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i> [<i>severely</i>].&nbsp; Hush!&nbsp; Lord Fondleton.</p>
<p>[<i>There is a dead silence for some minutes</i>.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Gloring</i> [<i>excitedly</i>].&nbsp; Oh, I hear it!&nbsp;
<!-- page 9--><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>It is something like
a woodpecker inside of one.</p>
<p><i>Drygull</i>.&nbsp; Not a word, my dear madam, if you please.</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i> [<i>after a long pause</i>].&nbsp; I imagine
I hear a very faint something; there it goes&mdash;boom, boom, boom&mdash;at
the back of my tympanum.</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not like a woodpecker.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Gloring</i>.&nbsp; No; it seems to me more like tic-tic-tic.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; How too tiresome!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t hear
anything.&nbsp; I suppose it is on account of the rumble of the carriages.</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i> [<i>whispers to</i> Mrs Gloring].&nbsp; I hear
something inside of me; do you know what?</p>
<p><i>Mrs Gloring</i>.&nbsp; No; what?</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i>.&nbsp; The beating of my own heart.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
you guess for whom?</p>
<p><i>Mrs Gloring</i>.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Perhaps the Rishi makes it beat.</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i>.&nbsp; Dear Mrs Gloring, you are the Rishi
for whom&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mrs Gloring</i>.&nbsp; Hush!</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; There, it is getting louder, <!-- page 10--><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>like
distant artillery, and yet so near.&nbsp; Oh, Mr Drygull, what a wonderful
man the Rishi must be!</p>
<p><i>Drygull</i>.&nbsp; Yes; he knew that at this hour to-day I should
need an illustration of his power, and he is kindly furnishing us with
one.&nbsp; This is an experience which I think our friend over there
[<i>looking towards</i> Mr Germsell] would find it difficult to classify.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; Fussle, have the goodness to step here for
a moment&mdash;[<i>points to a woman beating a carpet in the back-yard
of an adjoining house</i>].&nbsp; That is the tom-tom in the Himalayas
they are listening to.</p>
<p><i>Fussle</i>.&nbsp; Well, now, do you know, I don&rsquo;t feel quite
sure of that.&nbsp; I was certainly conscious of a sort of internal
hearing of something when you called me, which was not that; it was
as though I had fiddlestrings in my head and somebody was beginning
to strum upon them.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; Fiddlestrings indeed&mdash;say rather fiddlesticks.&nbsp;
I am surprised at a sensible man like yourself listening to such nonsense.</p>
<p><i>Fussle</i> [<i>testily</i>].&nbsp; It is much greater nonsense
for you to tell me I don&rsquo;t hear something I do hear, than for
me to hear something you can&rsquo;t <!-- page 11--><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>hear.&nbsp;
You may be deaf, while my sense of hearing may be evolving.&nbsp; Can
you hear what Lord Fondleton is saying to Mrs Gloring at this moment?</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; No, and I don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p><i>Fussle</i>.&nbsp; Ah, there it is.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t hear
anything you don&rsquo;t want to.&nbsp; Now I can, and he ought not
to say it;&mdash;look how she is blushing.&nbsp; Oh, I forgot you are
short-sighted.&nbsp; Well, you see, I can hear further than you, and
see further than you.&nbsp; Why should you set a limit on the evolution
of the senses, and say that no man in the future can ever hear or see
further than men have in the past?&nbsp; How dare you, sir, with your
imperfect faculties and your perfunctory method of research, which can
only cover an infinitesimal period in the existence of this planet,
venture to limit the potentialities of those laws which have already
converted us from ascidians into men, and which may as easily evolve
in us the faculty of hearing tom-toms in the Himalayas while we are
sitting here, as of that articulate speech or intelligent reasoning
which, owing to their operation, we now possess?</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; Pardon me, you do not possess them, Mr Fussle.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp;
Mr Fussle, might I ask you to take this cup of tea to Mrs Allmash?&nbsp;
Mr Germsell, it would be too kind of you to hand Mrs Gloring the cake.</p>
<p><i>Fussle</i> [<i>savagely</i>].&nbsp; We will continue this conversation
at the Minerva.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i> [<i>apart to the</i> Khoja].&nbsp; Oh, Mr Allyside,
I am so glad to hear that you speak English so perfectly!&nbsp; I want
you to tell me all about your religion; perhaps it may help us, you
know, to find the religion of the future, which we are all longing for.&nbsp;
And I am so interested in oriental religions! there is something so
charmingly picturesque about them.&nbsp; I quite dote on those dear
old Shastras, and Vedas, and Puranas; they contain such a lot of beautiful
things, you know.</p>
<p><i>Ali Seyyid</i>.&nbsp; I know as little, madam, of the Indian books
you mention as I do of the Bible, which I have always heard was a very
good book, and contained also a great many beautiful things.&nbsp; I
am neither a Hindoo nor a Buddhist,&mdash;in fact, it is forbidden to
me by my religion to tell you exactly what I am.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; But indeed I won&rsquo;t tell anybody if
you will only confide in me.&nbsp; Oh, this <!-- page 13--><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>mystery
is too exquisitely delicious!&nbsp; Who knows, perhaps you might make
a convert of me?</p>
<p><i>Ali Seyyid</i> [<i>with an admiring gaze</i>].&nbsp; Madam, you
would be a prize so well worth winning, that you almost tempt me.&nbsp;
The first of our secrets is that we are all things to all men, until
we are quite sure of the sympathy of the listener; then we venture a
step further.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; How wise that is! and how unlike the system
adopted by Christians!&nbsp; You may be sure of my most entire sympathy.</p>
<p><i>Ali Seyyid</i>.&nbsp; The next principle is&mdash;but this is
a profound secret, which you must promise not to repeat&mdash;the rejection
of all fixed rules of religion or morality.&nbsp; It really does not
matter in the least what you do: the internal disposition is the only
thing of any value.&nbsp; Now, as far as I understand, you have already
got rid of the religion, or you would not be looking for a new one;
all you have to do is to get rid of the morality, and there you are.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i> [<i>with an expression of horror and alarm</i>].&nbsp;
Yes, there I should be indeed.&nbsp; Oh, Mr Allyside, what a dreadful
man you <!-- page 14--><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>are!&nbsp;
Who started such an extraordinary doctrine?</p>
<p><i>Ali Seyyid</i>.&nbsp; Well, his name was Hassan-bin-Saba&mdash;commonly
known among Westerns as the &ldquo;Old Man of the Mountain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His followers, owing to the value they attached to murder as a remedial
agent, have been known by the name of the &ldquo;Assassins.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; Oh, good gracious!</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; My dear Louisa, what is the matter?&nbsp;
You look quite frightened.</p>
<p><i>Ali Seyyid</i>.&nbsp; Mrs Allmash is a little alarmed because
I proposed a new morality for the future, as well as a new religion.</p>
<p><i>Mr Coldwaite</i>.&nbsp; Excuse me; but in discussions of this
sort, I think it is most important that we should clearly understand
the meanings of the terms we employ.&nbsp; Now I deny that any difference
subsists between religion and morality.&nbsp; That any such distinction
should exist in men&rsquo;s minds is due to the fact that dogma is inseparably
connected with religion.&nbsp; If you eliminate dogma, what does religion
consist of but morality?&nbsp; Substitute the love of Humanity for the
love of the Unknowable&mdash;which is the subject of worship of Mr Germsell;
or of the Deity, who is the object <!-- page 15--><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>of
worship of the majority of mankind&mdash;and you obtain a stimulus to
morality which will suffice for all human need.&nbsp; It is in this
great emotion, as it seems to me, that you will find at once the religion
and the morality of the future.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; From what source do you get the force which
enables you to love humanity with a devotion so intense that it shall
elevate your present moral standard?</p>
<p><i>Coldwaite</i>.&nbsp; From humanity itself.&nbsp; I am not going
to be entrapped into getting it from any unknowable source; the love
of humanity, whether it be humanity as existing, or when absorbed by
death into the general mass, is perpetually generating itself.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; Then it must produce itself from what was
there before; therefore it must be the same love, which keeps on going
round and round.</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i>.&nbsp; A sort of circular love, in fact.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve often felt it: but I didn&rsquo;t think it right to encourage
it.</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; Lord Fondleton, how can you be so silly?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t pay attention to him, Mr Coldwaite.&nbsp; I confess I still
don&rsquo;t see how you can get a higher love out of humanity <!-- page 16--><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>than
humanity has already got in it, unless you are to look to some other
source for it.</p>
<p><i>Coldwaite</i>.&nbsp; Why, mayn&rsquo;t it evolve from itself?</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; How can it evolve without a propulsive force
behind it?&nbsp; The thing is too palpable an absurdity to need argument.&nbsp;
You can no more fix limits to the origin of force than you can destroy
its persistency.</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i> [<i>aside</i>].&nbsp; That seems to me one
of those sort of things no fellow can understand.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; All you can say of it is that it is a conditioned
effect of an unconditioned cause.&nbsp; That no idea or feeling arises,
save as a result of some physical force expended in producing it, is
fast becoming a commonplace of science; and whoever duly weighs the
evidence will see that nothing but an overwhelming bias in favour of
a preconceived theory can explain its non-acceptance.&nbsp; I think
my friend Mr Herbert Spencer has demonstrated this conclusively.</p>
<p><i>Coldwaite</i>.&nbsp; Pardon me; do I understand you to say that
the mental process which enabled Mr Spencer to elaborate his system
of philosophy, or that the profound emotion <!-- page 17--><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>which
finds its expression in a love for humanity, are the result of physical
force alone?</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; He says so himself, and he ought to know.&nbsp;
His whole system of philosophy is nothing more nor less than the result
of the liberation of certain forces produced by chemical action in the
brain.</p>
<p><i>Drygull</i>.&nbsp; Then, if I understand you rightly, if the chemical
changes which have been taking place for some years past in his brain
had liberated a different set of forces, we should have had altogether
a different philosophy.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; The chemical changes would in that case have
been different.</p>
<p><i>Drygull</i>.&nbsp; But the changes must be produced by forces
acting on them.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; Exactly: a force which has its source in the
Unknowable produces a certain chemical action in the brain by which
it becomes converted into thought or emotion, into love or philosophy,
into art or religion, as the case may be: what the nature of that love
or philosophy, or art or religion, may be, must depend entirely on the
nature of the chemical change.</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i> [<i>aside to</i> Mrs Gloring].&nbsp; I <!-- page 18--><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>feel
the most delightful chemical changes taking place now in my brain, dear
Mrs Gloring.&nbsp; May I explain to you the exquisite nature of the
forces that are being liberated, and which produce emotions of the most
tender character.</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i> [<i>sharply</i>].&nbsp; What are you saying,
Lord Fondleton?</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i>.&nbsp; Ahem&mdash;I was saying&mdash;ahem&mdash;I
was saying that we shall be having some Yankee inventing steam thinking-mills
and galvanic loving-batteries soon.&nbsp; What a lot of wear and tear
it would save!&nbsp; I should go about covered with a number of electric
love-wires for the force to play upon.</p>
<p><i>Fussle</i>.&nbsp; I think this matter wants clearing up, Mr Germsell.&nbsp;
Why don&rsquo;t you write a book on mental and emotional physics?</p>
<p><i>Mr Rollestone</i>.&nbsp; I would venture with great diffidence
to remark that the confusion seems to me to arise from the limit we
attach to the meaning of the word employed.&nbsp; It may be quite true
that no idea or emotion can exist except as the result of physical force;
but it is also true that its effect must be conditioned on the quality
of the force.&nbsp; There is as wide a difference between the physical
forces <!-- page 19--><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>operant in the
brain, and which give rise to ideas, and those which move a steam-engine,
as there is between mind and matter as popularly defined.&nbsp; Both,
as Mr Germsell will admit, are conditioned manifestations of force;
but the one contains a vital element in its dynamism which the other
does not.&nbsp; You may apply as much physical force by means of a galvanic
battery to a dead brain as you please, but you can&rsquo;t strike an
idea out of it; and this vital force, while it is &ldquo;conditioned
force,&rdquo; like light and heat, differs in its mode of manifestation
from every other manifestation of force, even more than they do from
each other, in that it possesses a potency inherent to it, which they
have not, and this potency it is which creates emotion and generates
ideas.&nbsp; The fallacy which underlies the whole of this system of
philosophy is contained in the assumption that there is only one description
of physical force in nature.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; No more there is.&nbsp; Why, Mr Spencer says
that the law of metamorphosis which holds among the physical forces,
holds equally between them and the mental forces; but mark you, what
is the grand conclusion <!-- page 20--><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>at
which he arrives?&nbsp; I happen to remember the passage: &ldquo;How
this metamorphosis takes place; how a force existing, as motion, heat,
or light, can become a mode of consciousness; how it is possible for
aerial vibrations to generate the sensation we call sound; or for the
forces liberated by chemical changes in the brain to give rise to emotion,&mdash;these
are mysteries which it is impossible to fathom.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i> [<i>aside to</i> Mrs Gloring].&nbsp; What a
jolly easy way of getting out of a difficulty!</p>
<p><i>Drygull</i>.&nbsp; Of course, if you admit such gross ignorance
as to how it is possible for aerial vibrations &ldquo;to generate the
sensation we call sound,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t wonder at your not hearing
the tom-tom in the Himalayas we were listening to just now.&nbsp; If
you knew a little more about the astral law under which aerial vibrations
may be generated, you would not call things impossible which you admit
to be unfathomable mysteries.&nbsp; If it is an unfathomable mystery
how a sound is projected a mile, why do you refuse to admit the possibility
of its being projected two, or two hundred, or two thousand?&nbsp; Under
the laws <!-- page 21--><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>which govern
mysteries, which you say are unfathomable, if the mystery is unfathomable,
so is the law, and you have no right to limit its action.</p>
<p><i>Rollestone</i>.&nbsp; To come back to the question of a possible
distinction in the essential or inherent qualities of dynamic or physical
forces.&nbsp; There is nothing in the hypothesis which may not be reasonably
assumed and tested by experiment; and before any man has a right to
affirm that there is only one quality of physical force in nature, which,
by undergoing transformation and metamorphosis, shall account for all
its phenomena, I have a right to ask whether the hypothesis, that there
may be another, has been experimentally tested.&nbsp; It would then
be time for me to accept the conclusion that there is only one, and
that it is an unfathomable mystery how this one force should be able
to perform all the functions attributed to it.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; I admit that the forces called vital are correlates
of the forces called physical, if you choose to call that a distinction;
but their character is conditioned by the state of the brain, and it
comes to the same thing in the end.&nbsp; The seat of emotion as well
as of <!-- page 22--><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>thought is the
brain, and it entirely depends on its chemical constitution, on its
circulation, and on other causes affecting that organ, what you think,
and feel, and say, and do.&nbsp; People&rsquo;s characters differ because
their brains do, not because there is any difference in the vital force
which animates them.</p>
<p><i>Rollestone</i>.&nbsp; You might as well say that sounds differ
because their aerial vibrations differ, but those vibrations only differ
because the force makes them differ which is acting upon them.&nbsp;
They don&rsquo;t generate tunes, but convey them.&nbsp; And the result,
so far as our hearing is concerned, depends upon what are called the
acoustic conditions under which the vibrations take place.&nbsp; Just
so the brain possesses no generating function of its own; it deals with
and transmits the ideas and emotions projected upon it according to
the organic conditions by which it may be affected at the time, whether
those ideas and emotions are produced by external stimuli, or apparently,
but only apparently, as I believe, owe their origin to genesis in the
brain itself.&nbsp; In the one case the brain is vibrating to the touch
of an external force, in the other to one that is internal <!-- page 23--><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>and
unseen, just as the air does when it transmits sound, whether you see
the cause which produces it or not; and the mystery which remains to
be fathomed, but which I do not admit to be unfathomable until somebody
tries to fathom it, is the nature of those unseen forces.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; How would you propose to try and fathom it?</p>
<p><i>Rollestone</i>.&nbsp; By experiment: I know of no other way.&nbsp;
The forces which generate emotions and ideas must possess a moral quality:
the experiments must therefore be moral experiments.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; How do you set to work to experimentalise
morally?</p>
<p><i>Rollestone</i>.&nbsp; As the process must of necessity be a purely
personal one, carried on, if I may use the expression, in one&rsquo;s
own moral organism, I have a certain delicacy in attempting to describe
it.&nbsp; In fact, Lady Fritterly, if you will allow me to say so, as
the whole subject which has been under discussion this afternoon is
the most profoundly solemn which can engage the attention of a human
being, I shrink from entering upon it as fully as I would do under other
circumstances.&nbsp; I <!-- page 24--><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>people
begin to want a new religion because it is the fashion to want one,
I venture to predict that they will never find it.&nbsp; If they want
a new religion because they can&rsquo;t come up to the moral standard
of the one they have got, then I would advise them to look rather to
that unseen force within them, which I have been attempting to describe
to Mr Germsell, for the potency which may enable them to reach it.</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; Indeed, Mr Rollestone, we are all exceedingly
in earnest.&nbsp; I never felt so serious in my life.&nbsp; Of course
this London life must all seem very frivolous to you; but that we can&rsquo;t
help, you know.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t all go away and make moral experiments
like you.&nbsp; What we feel is, that we ought all to endeavour as much
as possible to introduce a more serious tone into society.&nbsp; We
want to get rid of the selfishness, and the littlenesses, and the petty
ambitions and envyings, and the scandals that go on.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
we, Louisa, dear?&nbsp; And you can&rsquo;t think how grateful I am
to Lord Fondleton for having given me the pleasure of your acquaintance.&nbsp;
I hope I may often see you; I am sure you would do us all so much good.&nbsp;
You will <!-- page 25--><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>always find
me at home on Sunday afternoons at this hour.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; It is so refreshing to meet any one so
full of information and earnestness as you are, in this wicked, jaded
London.&nbsp; Please go on, Mr Rollestone; what you were saying was
so interesting.&nbsp; Have you really been experimentalising on your
own moral organism?&nbsp; How quite too extraordinary!</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i> [<i>aside to</i> Mrs Gloring].&nbsp; By Jove!&nbsp;
I had no idea old Rollestone could come out in this line.&nbsp; He is
a regular dark horse.&nbsp; I should never have suspected it.&nbsp;
He will be first favourite in London this season, and win in a canter.</p>
<p><i>Coldwaite</i>.&nbsp; You will excuse me, Mr Rollestone, but I
really am interested, and I really am serious.&nbsp; It was with no
idle curiosity that I was waiting to hear your answer to Mr Germsell&rsquo;s
inquiry, as to the nature of the moral experiment necessary to test
the character of this unseen force.</p>
<p><i>Rollestone</i>.&nbsp; I can only say that any experiment which
deals with the affectional and emotional part of one&rsquo;s nature
must be painful in the extreme.&nbsp; There is, indeed, only one motive
<!-- page 26--><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>which would induce
one to undergo the trials, sufferings, sacrifices, and ordeals which
it involves&mdash;and that is one in which you will sympathise: it is
the hope that humanity may benefit by the result of one&rsquo;s efforts.&nbsp;
Indeed, any lower motive than this would vitiate them.&nbsp; I will
venture to assert to Mr Germsell, who is so sceptical as to the existence
of any other quality in that force, which he can only fathom so far
as to know that it is physical, that I will put him through a course
of experiment which will cause him more acute moral suffering than his
brain could bear, unless it was sustained by a force which, by that
experimental process, will reveal attributes contained in it not dreamt
of in his philosophy.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; I have no doubt you could strain my mind until
it was weak enough to believe anything, even your fantastic theories.&nbsp;
Thank you, I would rather continue to experiment with my own microscope
and forceps than let you experiment either upon my affections or my
brains.</p>
<p><i>Fussle</i> [<i>aside to</i> Mr Rollestone].&nbsp; You could not
make anything of them even if he consented&mdash;the former don&rsquo;t
exist, and the <!-- page 27--><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>latter
are mere putty&mdash;but I can quite understand your desire to begin
<i>in corpore vili</i>.</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i> [<i>aside to</i> Mrs Gloring].&nbsp; Allow
me freely to offer you my affections as peculiarly adapted to experiments
of this nature.</p>
<p><i>Rollestone</i>.&nbsp; It has always struck me as strange that
men of science, who don&rsquo;t shrink from testing, for instance, the
value of poisons, or the nature of disease, by heroically subjecting
their own external organisms to their action, should shrink from experimenting
on that essential if remote vitalising force, which can only be reached
by moral experiment, and disorder in which produces not only moral obliquity
and mental alienation, but physical disease as well.</p>
<p><i>Fussle</i>.&nbsp; Thus a man may die of apoplexy brought on by
a fit of passion.&nbsp; Cure his temper, and you lessen the danger of
apoplexy; that, I take it, is an illustration of what you mean.</p>
<p><i>Rollestone</i>.&nbsp; In its most external application it is;
the question is where his bad temper comes from, and whether, as Mr
Germsell would maintain, it is entirely due to his cerebral <!-- page 28--><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>condition,
and not to the moral qualities inherent in the force, which, acting
on peculiar cerebral conditions, causes one man&rsquo;s temper to differ
from another&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is not the liberated force which generates
the temper.&nbsp; For that you have to go farther back; and the reason
why research is limited in this direction is not because it is impossible
to go farther back, but because it must inevitably entail, as I have
already said, acute personal suffering.&nbsp; Nor, as these experiments
must be purely personal, and involve experiences of an entirely novel
kind, is it possible to discuss them except with those who have participated
in them.&nbsp; One might as well attempt to describe the emotion of
love to a man whose affections had never been called forth.&nbsp; If
I have alluded to them so fully now, it is because they justify me in
making the assertion, for which I can offer no other proof than they
have afforded to me personally, that a force does exist in nature possessing
an inherent spiritual potency&mdash;I use the word spiritual for lack
of a better&mdash;which is capable of lifting humanity to a higher moral
plane of daily living and acting than that which it has hitherto attained.&nbsp;
But I fear <!-- page 29--><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>I am trespassing
on your patience in having said thus much.</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; Oh no, Mr Rollestone; please go on.&nbsp;
There is something so delightfully fresh and original in all you are
saying, I can&rsquo;t tell you how much you interest me.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i> [<i>aside</i>].&nbsp; I know a milkmaid quite as
fresh and rather more original.&nbsp; [<i>Aloud</i>, <i>looking at his
watch</i>.]&nbsp; Bless me! it is past six, and I have an appointment
at the club at six.&nbsp; So sorry to tear myself away, dear Lady Fritterly.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t tell you how I have enjoyed the intellectual treat you
have provided for me.</p>
<p><i>Lady Fritterly</i>.&nbsp; I thank you so much for coming.&nbsp;
I hope you will often look in on our Sundays.&nbsp; I think, you know,
that these little conversations are so very improving.</p>
<p><i>Germsell</i>.&nbsp; You may rely upon me; it is impossible to
imagine anything more interesting.&nbsp; [<i>Mutters as he leaves the
room</i>.]&nbsp; No, Lady Fritterly, this is the last time I enter this
house, except perhaps to dinner.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t catch me again
making one of your Sunday afternoon collection of bores and idiots.&nbsp;
What an insufferable prig that Rollestone is!</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span><i>Fussle</i> [<i>aside
to</i> Drygull].&nbsp; Thank heaven, that pompous nuisance has taken
himself off!</p>
<p><i>Drygull</i> [<i>aside to</i> Fussle].&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
which I dislike most&mdash;the Pharisee of science or the Pharisee of
religion.</p>
<p><i>Rollestone</i>.&nbsp; If, then, you admit that the human organism
not only cannot generate force, but that the emotions which control
the body are in their turn generated by a force which is behind it,
and that this force is dependent for its manifestation on its own special
conditions, as well as on those of its transmitting organic medium,
I venture to assert that experiment in the direction I have suggested
will prove to our consciousness that the moral or spiritual quality
of the original invading force is a pure one, and that the degree of
its pollution in the human frame is the effect of inherited and other
organic conditions; and the question which presents itself to the experimentalist
is, whether by an effort of the will this same force may not be evoked
to change and purify those conditions.&nbsp; Indeed the very effort
is in itself an invocation, and if made unflinchingly, will not fail
to meet with a response.&nbsp; Much that has heretofore been <!-- page 31--><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>to
earnest seekers unknowable will become knowable, and a love, Mr Coldwaite,
higher, if that be possible, than the love of humanity, yet correlative
with and inseparable from it, will be found pressing with an irresistible
potency into those vacant spaces of the human heart, which have from
all time yearned for a closer contact with the Great Source of all love
and of all force.&nbsp; It is in this attempt to sever the love of humanity
from its Author, that the Positivist philosophy has failed: it is the
worship of a husk without the kernel, of a body without the soul; and
hence it will never satisfy the human aspiration.&nbsp; That aspiration
is ever the same; it needs, if you will allow me to say so, Lady Fritterly,
no new religion to satisfy its demands.&nbsp; If the world is of late
beginning to feel dissatisfied with Christianity, it is not because
the moral standard which that religion proposes is not sufficiently
lofty for its requirements, but because, after eighteen hundred years
of effort, its professors have altogether failed to reach that standard.&nbsp;
Christianity seems a failure because Christians have failed&mdash;have
failed to understand its application to everyday life, have failed to
embody it in practice, and have <!-- page 32--><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>sought
an escape from the apparent impossibility of doing so, by smothering
it with dogmas, and diverting its scope from this world to the next.&nbsp;
It will be time to look for a new religion, when we have succeeded in
the literal application of the ethics of the one we have got to the
social and economic problems of daily life.&nbsp; It is not by any intellectual
effort or scientific process that the discovery will be made of how
this is to be done, but by the introduction into the organism of new
and unsuspected potencies of moral force which have hitherto lain dormant
in nature, waiting for the great invocation of wearied and distressed
humanity.&nbsp; There can be no stronger evidence of the approach of
this new force, destined to make the ethics of Christianity a practical
social standard, than the growing demand of society for a new religion.&nbsp;
It is the inarticulate utterance of the quickened human aspiration,
in itself a proof that these new potencies are already stirring the
dry bones of Christendom, and a sure earnest that their coming in answer
to that aspiration will not be long delayed.</p>
<p><i>Drygull</i>.&nbsp; Of course, I entirely disagree with you as
to any such necessity in regard to the <!-- page 33--><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>moral
requirements of the world, existing.&nbsp; You must have met, in the
course of your travels, that more enlightened and initiated class of
Buddhists, with whom I sympathise, who are quite indifferent to considerations
of this nature.</p>
<p><i>Rollestone</i>.&nbsp; And who were too much occupied with their
subjective prospects in Nirvana, to be affected by the needs of terrestrial
humanity.</p>
<p><i>Drygull</i>.&nbsp; Quite so.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; And, Mr Allyside, I am afraid you are equally
indifferent.</p>
<p><i>Ali Seyyid</i>.&nbsp; I am certainly not indifferent to the discovery
of any force latent in Christendom which may check the force of its
cupidity, and put a stop to the <i>exploitation</i> and subjugation
of Eastern countries for the sake of advancing its own material interests,
under the specious pretext of introducing the blessings of civilisation.</p>
<p><i>Coldwaite</i>.&nbsp; You have certainly presented the matter in
a light which is altogether new to me, Mr Rollestone, and upon which,
therefore, I am not now prepared to express an opinion.&nbsp; I should
like to discuss the subject with you further privately.</p>
<p><!-- page 34--><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span><i>Rollestone</i>.&nbsp;
It is a subject which should never be discussed except privately.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i>.&nbsp; Now, I should say, Mr Rollestone, on the
contrary, that it was just a subject you ought to write a book about.&nbsp;
You would have so much to tell,&mdash;all your personal experiments,
you know; now do.</p>
<p><i>Fussle</i>.&nbsp; Take my advice, Mr Rollestone, and don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
You would have very few readers, and those who read you would only sneer
at what they would call your crude ideas; and indeed, you will excuse
me for saying so, but I am not sure that they would not be right.</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i>.&nbsp; I quite disagree with you, Mr Fussle.&nbsp;
If Rollestone would write a book which would put a stop to this &ldquo;religion
of the future&rdquo; business, he would earn the gratitude of society.&nbsp;
Do you know, I am getting rather bored with it.</p>
<p><i>Fussle</i>.&nbsp; Not if he introduced instead a latent force,
which should overturn all existing institutions, and revolutionise society&mdash;which
it would inevitably have to do if we were all coerced by it into adopting
literally the ethics of Christianity, instead of merely professing them.&nbsp;
Why, the &ldquo;Sermon on the Mount&rdquo; alone, practised to the letter,
would produce <!-- page 35--><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>a general
destruction.&nbsp; Church and State, and the whole economic system upon
which society is based, would melt away before it like an iceberg under
a tropical sun.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind discussing the religion of
the future as a subject of interesting speculation; but, depend upon
it, we had better let well alone.&nbsp; It seems to me that we&mdash;at
least those of us who are well off&mdash;have nothing to complain of.&nbsp;
Let us trust to the silent forces of evolution.&nbsp; See how much they
have lately done for us in the matter of art.&nbsp; What can be pleasanter
than this gentle process of &aelig;sthetic development which our higher
faculties are undergoing?&nbsp; With due deference to Mr Rollestone,
I think we shall be far better employed in cultivating our taste, than
in probing our own organisms in the hope of discovering forces which
may enable us to apply a perfectly unpractical system of morality, to
a society which has every reason to be satisfied with the normal progress
it is making.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Gloring</i>.&nbsp; Indeed, Mr Rollestone, I agree with you
a great deal more than with Mr Fussle.&nbsp; I should like to call out
a higher moral force in myself&mdash;but I should never have the courage
to undergo all the ordeals <!-- page 36--><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>you
say it would involve; I am too weak to try.</p>
<p><i>Lord Fondleton</i>.&nbsp; Of course you are,&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&nbsp;
You are much nicer as you are.&nbsp; Why, Rollestone, you would make
all the women detestable if you could have your way.</p>
<p><i>Rollestone</i>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think there is any immediate
cause for alarm on that score.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Allmash</i> [<i>rising</i>].&nbsp; Dearest Augusta, I am afraid
I must run away: thank you <i>so</i> much, for <i>such</i> a treat.&nbsp;
[<i>All rise</i>]&nbsp; Mrs Gloring, we have all been so deeply interested,
that we have scarcely been able to exchange a word, but I hope we shall
see a great deal of each other this year.&nbsp; I have a few people
coming to me to-morrow evening; do you think you can spare a moment
from your numerous engagements?&nbsp; Lady Fritterly and Lord Fondleton
are coming; and perhaps, Mr Drygull, you will come, and bring Mr Allyside.&nbsp;
Mr Fussle, I know it is useless to expect you; and I cannot venture
to ask Mr Rollestone to anything so frivolous.&nbsp; But perhaps you
will dine with me on Thursday&mdash;you will meet some congenial spirits.</p>
<p><i>Rollestone</i>.&nbsp; Thank you, but I fear it will be impossible,
as I leave London to-morrow.&nbsp; <!-- page 37--><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Good-bye,
Lady Fritterly.&nbsp; Forgive me, an utter stranger, for having so far
obtruded my experiences upon you, and for venturing finally to suggest
that it is in our own hearts that we should search for the religion
that we need; for is it not written, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is
within you&rdquo;?</p>
<h2><!-- page 38--><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>THE BRIGAND&rsquo;S
BRIDE: A TALE OF SOUTHERN ITALY.</h2>
<p>The Italian peninsula during the years 1859-60-61 offered a particularly
tempting field for adventure to ardent spirits in search of excitement;
and, attracted partly by my sympathy with the popular movement, and
partly by that simple desire, which gives so much zest to the life of
youth, of risking it on all possible occasions, I had taken an active
part, chiefly as an officious spectator, in all the principal events
of those stirring years.&nbsp; It was in the spring of 1862 that I found
matters beginning to settle down to a degree that threatened monotony;
and with the termination of the winter gaieties at Naples and the close
of the San Carlo, I seriously bethought me of accepting the offer of
a naval friend who was about to engage in <!-- page 39--><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>blockade-running,
and offered to land me in the Confederate States, when a recrudescence
of activity on the part of the brigand bands in Calabria induced me
to turn my attention in that direction.&nbsp; The first question I had
to consider was, whether I should enjoy myself most by joining the brigands,
or the troops which were engaged in suppressing them.&nbsp; As the former
aspired to a political character, and called themselves patriotic bands
fighting for their Church, their country, and their King&mdash;the refugee
monarch of Naples&mdash;one could espouse their cause without exactly
laying one&rsquo;s self open to the charge of being a bandit; but it
was notorious in point of fact that the bands cared for neither the
Pope nor the exiled King nor their annexed country, but committed the
most abominable atrocities in the names of all the three, for the simple
purpose of filling their pockets.&nbsp; I foresaw not only extreme difficulty
in being accepted as a member of the fraternity, more especially as
I had hitherto been identified with the Garibaldians; but also the probability
of finding myself compromised by acts from which my conscience would
revolt, and for which my life <!-- page 40--><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>would
in all likelihood pay the forfeit.&nbsp; On the other hand, I could
think of no friend among the officers of the Bersaglieri and cavalry
regiments, then engaged in brigand-hunting in the Capitanata and Basilicata,
to whom I could apply for an invitation to join them.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, I determined to trust to the chapter of
accidents; and armed with a knapsack, a sketch-book, and an air-gun,
took my seat one morning in the Foggia diligence, with the vague idea
of getting as near the scene of operations as possible, and seeing what
would turn up.&nbsp; The air-gun was not so much a weapon of offence
or defence as a means of introduction to the inhabitants.&nbsp; It had
the innocent appearance of rather a thick walking-cane, with a little
brass trigger projecting; and in the afternoon I would join the group
sitting in front of the chemist&rsquo;s, which, for some reason or other,
is generally a sort of open-air club in a small Neapolitan town, or
stroll into the single modest <i>caf&eacute;</i> of which it might possibly
boast, and toy abstractedly with the trigger.&nbsp; This, together with
my personal appearance&mdash;for do what I would, I could never make
myself <!-- page 41--><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>look like a
Neapolitan&mdash;would be certain to attract attention, and some one
bolder than the rest would make himself the spokesman, and politely
ask me whether the cane in my hand was an umbrella or a fishing-rod;
on which I would amiably reply that it was a gun, and that I should
have much pleasure in exhibiting my skill and the method of its operation
to the assembled company.&nbsp; Then the whole party would follow me
to an open space, and I would call for a pack of cards, and possibly&mdash;for
I was a good shot in those days&mdash;pink the ace of hearts at fifteen
paces.&nbsp; At any rate my performances usually called forth plaudits,
and this involved a further interchange of compliments and explanations,
and the production of my sketch-book, which soon procured me the acquaintance
of some ladies and an invitation as an English artist, to the house
of some respectable citizen.</p>
<p>So it happened that, getting out of the diligence before it reached
Foggia, I struck south, and wandered for some days from one little town
to another, being always hospitably entertained, whether there happened
to be an <i>albergo</i> or not, at private houses, seeing in this way
more of the manners and customs of <!-- page 42--><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the
inhabitants than would have been otherwise possible, gaining much information
as to the haunts of the brigands, the whereabouts of the troops, and
hearing much local gossip generally.&nbsp; The ignorance of the most
respectable classes at this period was astounding; it has doubtless
all changed since.&nbsp; I have been at a town of 2000 inhabitants,
not one of whom took in a newspaper: the whole population, therefore,
was in as profound ignorance of what was transpiring in the rest of
the world as if they had been in Novaia Zemlia.&nbsp; I have stayed
with a mayor who did not know that England was an island; I have been
the guest of a citizen who had never heard of Scotland, and to whom,
therefore, my nationality was an enigma: but I never met any one&mdash;I
mean of this same class&mdash;who had not heard of Palmerston.&nbsp;
He was a mysterious personage, execrated by the &ldquo;blacks&rdquo;
and adored by the &ldquo;reds.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I shone with a reflected
lustre as the citizen of a country of which he was the Prime Minister.&nbsp;
As a consequence, we had political discussions, which were protracted
far into the night, for the principal meal of the twenty-four hours
was a 10 o&rsquo;clock <!-- page 43--><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span><span class="smcap">p.m</span>.
supper, at which, after the inevitable macaroni, were many unwholesome
dishes, such as salads made of thistles, cows&rsquo; udders, and other
delicacies, which deprived one of all desire for sleep.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
which, we rose early, my hostess and the ladies of the establishment
appearing in the early part of the day in the most extreme deshabille.&nbsp;
Indeed, on one occasion when I was first introduced into the family
of a respectable citizen, and shown into my bedroom, I mistook one of
two females who were making the bed for the servant, and was surprised
to see her hand a little douceur I gave her as an earnest of attention
on her part, to the other with a smile.&nbsp; She soon afterwards went
to bed: we all did, from 11 <span class="smcap">a.m</span>. till about
3 <span class="smcap">p.m</span>., at which hour I was horrified to
meet her arrayed in silks and satins, and to find that she was the wife
of my host.&nbsp; She kindly took me a drive with her in a carriage
and pair, and with a coachman in livery.</p>
<p>It was by this simple means, and by thus imposing myself upon the
hospitality of these unsophisticated people, that I worked my way by
slow degrees, chiefly on foot, into the part of the country I desired
to visit; and I <!-- page 44--><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>trust
that I in a measure repaid them for it by the stores of information
which I imparted to them, and of which they stood much in need, and
by little sketches of their homes and the surrounding scenery, with
which I presented them.&nbsp; I was, indeed, dependent in some measure
for hospitality of this description, as I had taken no money with me,
partly because, to tell the truth, I had scarcely got any, and partly
because I was afraid of being robbed by brigands of the little I had.&nbsp;
I therefore eschewed the character of a <i>milordo Inglese</i>; but
I never succeeded in dispelling all suspicion that I might not be a
nephew of the Queen, or at least a very near relative of &ldquo;Palmerston&rdquo;
in disguise.&nbsp; It was so natural, seeing what a deep interest both
her Majesty and the Prime Minister took in Italy, that they should send
some one <i>incognito</i> whom they could trust to tell them all about
it.</p>
<p>Meantime, I was not surprised, when I came to know the disposition
of the inhabitants, at the success of brigandage.&nbsp; It has never
been my fortune before or since to live among such a timid population.&nbsp;
One day at a large town a leading landed proprietor <!-- page 45--><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>received
notice that if he did not pay a certain sum in black-mail,&mdash;I forget
at this distance of time the exact amount,&mdash;his farm or <i>masseria</i>
would be robbed.&nbsp; This farm, which was in fact a handsome country-house,
was distant about ten miles from the town.&nbsp; He therefore made an
appeal to the citizens that they should arm themselves, and help him
to defend his property, as he had determined not to pay, and had taken
steps to be informed as to the exact date when the attack was to be
made in default of payment.&nbsp; More than 300 citizens enrolled themselves
as willing to turn out in arms.&nbsp; On the day preceding the attack
by the brigands, a rendezvous was given to these 300 on the great square
for five in the morning, and thither I accordingly repaired, unable,
however, to induce my host to accompany me, although he had signed as
a volunteer.&nbsp; On reaching the rendezvous, I found the landed proprietor
and a friend who was living with him, and about ten minutes afterwards
two other volunteers strolled up.&nbsp; Five was all we could muster
out of 300.&nbsp; It was manifestly useless to attempt anything with
so small a force, and no arguments could induce any of the others <!-- page 46--><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>to
turn out: so the unhappy gentleman had the satisfaction of knowing that
the brigands had punctually pillaged his place, carrying off all his
live stock on the very day and at the very hour they said they would.&nbsp;
As for the inhabitants venturing any distance from town, except under
military escort, such a thing was unknown, and all communication with
Naples was for some time virtually intercepted.&nbsp; I was regarded
as a sort of monomaniac of recklessness, because I ventured on a solitary
walk of a mile or two in search of a sketch,&mdash;an act of no great
audacity on my part, for I had walked through various parts of the country
without seeing a brigand, and found it difficult to realise that there
was any actual danger in strolling a mile from a moderately large town.</p>
<p>Emboldened by impunity, I was tempted one day to follow up a most
romantic glen in search of a sketch, when I came upon a remarkably handsome
peasant girl, driving a donkey before her loaded with wood.&nbsp; My
sudden appearance on the narrow path made the animal shy against a projecting
piece of rock, off which he rebounded to the edge of the path, which,
giving way, precipitated him <!-- page 47--><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>and
his load down the ravine.&nbsp; He was brought up unhurt against a bush
some twenty feet below, the fagots of wood being scattered in his descent
in all directions.&nbsp; For a moment the girl&rsquo;s large fierce
eyes flashed upon me with anger; but the impetuosity with which I went
headlong after the donkey, with a view of repairing my error, and the
absurd attempts I made to reverse the position of his feet, which were
in the air, converted her indignation into a hearty fit of laughter,
as, seeing that the animal was apparently uninjured, she scrambled down
to my assistance.&nbsp; By our united efforts we at last succeeded in
hoisting the donkey up to the path, and then I collected the wood and
helped her to load it again&mdash;an operation which involved a frequent
meeting of hands, and of the eyes, which had now lost the ferocity that
had startled me at first, and seemed getting more soft and beaming every
time I glanced at them, till at last, producing my sketch-book, I ventured
to remark, &ldquo;Ah, signorina, what a picture you would make!&nbsp;
Now that the ass is loaded, let me draw you before we part, that I may
carry away the recollection of the loveliest woman I have seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 48--><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>&ldquo;First draw
the donkey,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that I may carry away a recollection
of the <i>galantuomo</i> who first upset him over the bank, and then
helped me to load him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling at this ambiguous compliment, I gave her the sketch she desired,
and was about to claim my reward, when she abruptly remarked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not time now; it is getting late, and I must not
linger, as I have still an hour to go before reaching home.&nbsp; How
is it that you are not afraid to be wandering in this solitary glen
by yourself?&nbsp; Do you not know the risks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of them, but I do not believe in them,&rdquo;
I said; &ldquo;besides, I should be poor plunder for robbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have friends, who would pay to ransom you, I suppose,
if you were captured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life is not worth a hundred <i>scudi</i> to any of them,&rdquo;
I replied, laughing; &ldquo;but I am willing to forego the pleasure
of drawing you now, <i>bellissima</i>, if you will tell me where you
live, and let me come and paint you there at my leisure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brave one,&rdquo; she said, with a little laugh;
&ldquo;there is not another man in all Ascoli <!-- page 49--><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>who
would dare to pay me a visit without an escort of twenty soldiers.&nbsp;
But I am too grateful for your amiability to let you run such a risk.&nbsp;
<i>Addio</i>, Signer Inglese.&nbsp; There are many reasons why I can&rsquo;t
let you draw my picture, but I am not ungrateful, see!&rdquo;&mdash;and
she offered me her cheek, on which I instantly imprinted a chaste and
fraternal salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;ve seen the last of me, <i>carissima</i>,&rdquo;
I called out, as she turned away.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall live on the memory
of that kiss till I have an opportunity of repeating it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as I watched her retreating figure with an artist&rsquo;s eye,
I was struck with its grace and suppleness, combined, as I had observed
while she was helping me to load the donkey, with an unusual degree
of muscular strength for a woman.</p>
<p>The spot at which this episode had taken place was so romantic, that
I determined to make a sketch of it, and the shades of evening were
closing in so fast that they warned me to hurry if I would reach the
town before dark.&nbsp; I had just finished it, and was stooping to
pick up my air-gun, when I heard a <!-- page 50--><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>sudden
rush, and before I had time to look up, I was thrown violently forward
on my face, and found myself struggling in the embrace of a powerful
grasp, from which I had nearly succeeded in freeing myself, when the
arms which were clasping me were reinforced by several more pair, and
I felt a rope being passed round my body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, signors!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;I yield to
superior numbers.&nbsp; You need not pull so hard; let me get up, and
I promise to go with you quietly.&rdquo;&nbsp; And by this time I had
turned sufficiently on my back to see that four men were engaged in
tying me up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie his elbows together, and let him get up,&rdquo; said one;
&ldquo;he is not armed.&nbsp; Here, Giuseppe, carry his stick and paint-box,
while I feel his pockets.&nbsp; <i>Corpo di Baccho</i>! twelve <i>bajocchi</i>,&rdquo;
he exclaimed, producing those copper coins with an air of profound disgust.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is to be hoped he is worth more to his friends.&nbsp; Now,
young man, trudge, and remember that the first sign you make of attempting
to run away, means four bullets through you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I did not anticipate any real danger, and as a prolonged detention
was a matter <!-- page 51--><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>of no
consequence to a man without an occupation, I stepped forward with a
light heart, rather pleased than otherwise with anticipations of the
brigand&rsquo;s cave, and turning over in my mind whether or not I should
propose to join the band.</p>
<p>We had walked an hour, and it had become dark, when we turned off
the road, up a narrow path that led between rocky sides to a glade,
at the extremity of which, under an overhanging ledge, was a small cottage,
with what seemed to be a patch of garden in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho!&nbsp; Anita!&rdquo; called out the man who appeared to
be the leader of the band; &ldquo;open!&nbsp; We have brought a friend
to supper, who will require a night&rsquo;s lodgings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An old woman with a light appeared, and over her shoulder, to my
delight, I saw the face I had asked to be allowed to paint so shortly
before.&nbsp; I was about to recognise her with an exclamation, when
I saw a hurried motion of her finger to her lip, which looked a natural
gesture to the casual observer, but which I construed into a sign of
prudence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you pick him up, Croppo?&rdquo; <!-- page 52--><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>she
asked carelessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He ought to be worth something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just twelve <i>bajocchi</i>,&rdquo; he answered with a sneering
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, <i>amico mio</i>, you will have to give us
the names of some of your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tolerably intimate with his Holiness the Pope, and I
have a bowing acquaintance with the King of Naples, whom may God speedily
restore to his own,&rdquo; I replied in a light and airy fashion, which
seemed exceedingly to exasperate the man called Croppo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, we know all about that; we never catch a man who does
not profess to be a <i>Nero</i> of the deepest dye in order to conciliate
our sympathies.&nbsp; It is just as well that you should understand,
my friend, that all are fish who come into our net.&nbsp; The money
of the Pope&rsquo;s friends is quite as good as the money of Garibaldi&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
You need not hope to put us off with your Italian friends of any colour:
what we want is English gold&mdash;good solid English gold, and plenty
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said I, with a laugh, &ldquo;if you did but know,
my friend, how long I have wanted it too.&nbsp; If you could only suggest
an Englishman <!-- page 53--><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>who would
pay you for my life, I would write to him immediately, and we would
go halves in the ransom.&nbsp; Hold!&rdquo; I said, a bright idea suddenly
striking me; &ldquo;suppose I were to write to my Government&mdash;how
would that do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Croppo was evidently puzzled: my cheerful and unembarrassed manner
apparently perplexed him.&nbsp; He had a suspicion that I was even capable
of the audacity of making a fool of him, and yet that proposition about
the Government rather staggered him.&nbsp; There might be something
in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; he remarked grimly, &ldquo;it
would add to the effect of your communication if you were to enclose
your own ears in your letter?&nbsp; I can easily supply them; and if
you are not a little more guarded in your speech, you may possibly have
to add your tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not have the slightest effect,&rdquo; I replied,
paying no heed to this threat; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know Palmerston
as I do.&nbsp; If you wish to get anything out of him you must be excessively
civil.&nbsp; What does he care about my ears?&rdquo;&nbsp; And I laughed
with such scornful contempt that Croppo this time felt that he <!-- page 54--><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>had
made a fool of himself; and I observed the lovely girl behind, while
the corners of her mouth twitched with suppressed laughter, make a sign
of caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Per Dio</i>!&rdquo; he exclaimed, jumping up with fury,
&ldquo;understand, Signor Inglese, that Croppo is not to be trifled
with.&nbsp; I have a summary way of treating disrespect,&rdquo; and
he drew a long and exceedingly sharp-looking two-edged knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you would kill the goose&rdquo;&mdash;and I certainly am
a goose, I reflected&mdash;&ldquo;that may lay a golden egg.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But my allusion was lost upon him, and I saw my charmer touch her forehead
significantly, as though to imply to Croppo that I was weak in the upper
storey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An imbecile without friends and twelve <i>bajocchi</i> in
his pocket,&rdquo; he muttered savagely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps the night
without food will restore his senses.&nbsp; Come, fool!&rdquo; and he
roughly pushed me into a dark little chamber adjoining.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,
Valeria, hold the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Valeria was the name of the heroine of the donkey episode.&nbsp;
As she held a small oil-lamp aloft, I perceived that the room in which
I was to spend the night had more <!-- page 55--><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>the
appearance of a cellar than a chamber; it had been excavated on two
sides from the bank, on the third there was a small hole about six inches
square, apparently communicating with another room, and on the fourth
was the door by which I had entered, and which opened into the kitchen
and general living-room of the inhabitants.&nbsp; There was a heap of
onions running to seed, the fagots of firewood which Valeria had brought
that afternoon, and an old cask or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you give him some kind of a bed?&rdquo; she asked
Croppo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! he can sleep on the onions,&rdquo; responded that worthy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If he had been more civil and intelligent he should have had
something to eat.&nbsp; You three,&rdquo; he went on, turning to the
other men, &ldquo;sleep in the kitchen, and watch that the prisoner
does not escape.&nbsp; The door has a strong bolt besides.&nbsp; Come,
Valeria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the pair disappeared, leaving me in a dense gloom, strongly pervaded
by an odour of fungus and decaying onions.&nbsp; Groping into one of
the casks, I found some straw, and spreading it on a piece of plank,
I prepared to pass the night sitting with my back <!-- page 56--><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>to
the driest piece of wall I could find, which happened to be immediately
under the airhole, a fortunate circumstance, as the closeness was often
stifling.&nbsp; I had probably been dozing for some time in a sitting
position, when I felt something tickle the top of my head.&nbsp; The
idea that it might be a large spider caused me to start, when stretching
up my hand, it came in contact with what seemed to be a rag, which I
had not observed.&nbsp; Getting carefully up, I perceived a faint light
gleaming through the aperture, and then saw that a hand was protruded
through it, apparently waving the rag.&nbsp; As I felt instinctively
that the hand was Valeria&rsquo;s, I seized the finger-tips, which was
all I could get hold of, and pressed them to my lips.&nbsp; They were
quickly drawn away, and then the whisper reached my ears&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then eat this,&rdquo; and she passed me a tin pannikin full
of cold macaroni, which would just go through the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Valeria,&rdquo; I said, with my mouth full, &ldquo;how
good and thoughtful you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! he&rsquo;ll hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Croppo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep in the bed just behind me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you come to be in his bedroom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&nbsp; A long pause during which I collapsed upon
my straw seat, and swallowed macaroni thoughtfully.&nbsp; As the result
of my meditations&mdash;&ldquo;Valeria <i>carissima</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&nbsp; Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get me out of this infernal den?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, if they all three sleep in the kitchen; at present
one is awake.&nbsp; Watch for my signal, and if they all three sleep,
I will manage to slip the bolt.&nbsp; Then you must give me time to
get back into bed, and when you hear me snore you may make the attempt.&nbsp;
They are all three sleeping on the floor, so be very careful where you
tread; I will also leave the front door a little open, so that you can
slip through without noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest Valeria!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&nbsp; Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand me that cane&mdash;it is my fishing-rod, you know&mdash;through
this hole; you can leave <!-- page 58--><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the
sketch-book and paint-box under the tree that the donkey fell against,&mdash;I
will call for them some day soon.&nbsp; And, Valeria, don&rsquo;t you
think we could make our lips meet through this beastly hole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s my hand; heavens!&nbsp; Croppo
would murder me if he knew.&nbsp; Now keep quiet till I give the signal.&nbsp;
Oh, do let go my hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, Valeria, <i>bellissima</i>, <i>carissima</i>, whatever
happens, that I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think she heard this, and I went and sat on the
onions because I could see the hole better, and the smell of them kept
me awake.</p>
<p>It was at least two hours after this that the faint light appeared
at the hole in the wall, and a hand was pushed through.&nbsp; I rushed
at the finger-tips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your fishing-rod,&rdquo; she said when I had
released them, and she had passed me my air-gun.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now be
very careful how you tread.&nbsp; There is one asleep across the door,
but you can open it about two feet.&nbsp; Then step over him; then make
for a gleam of moonlight that comes through the crack of the front door,
open it very gently and slip <!-- page 59--><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>out.&nbsp;
<i>Addio, caro Inglese</i>; mind you wait till you hear me snoring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she lingered, and I heard a sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it, sweet
Valeria?&rdquo; and I covered her hand with kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Croppo had blue eyes like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was murmured so softly that I may have been mistaken, but I&rsquo;m
nearly sure that was what she said; then she drew softly away, and two
minutes afterwards I heard her snoring.&nbsp; As the first sound issued
from her lovely nostrils, I stealthily approached the door, gently pushed
it open; stealthily stepped over a space which I trusted cleared the
recumbent figure that I could not see; cleared him; stole gently on
for the streak of moonlight; trod squarely on something that seemed
like an outstretched hand, for it gave under my pressure and produced
a yell; felt that I must now rush for my life; dashed the door open,
and down the path with four yelling ruffians at my heels.&nbsp; I was
a pretty good runner, but the moon was behind a cloud, and the way was
rocky,&mdash;moreover, there must have been a short cut I did not know,
for one of my pursuers gained upon me with unaccountable rapidity&mdash;he
appeared <!-- page 60--><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>suddenly within
ten yards of my heels.&nbsp; The others were at least a hundred yards
behind.&nbsp; I had nothing for it but to turn round, let him almost
run against the muzzle of my air-gun, pull the trigger, and see him
fall in his tracks.&nbsp; It was the work of a second, but it checked
my pursuers.&nbsp; They had heard no noise, but they found something
that they did not bargain for, and lingered a moment, then they took
up the chase with redoubled fury.&nbsp; But I had too good a start;
and where the path joined the main road, instead of turning down towards
the town, as they expected I would, I dodged round in the opposite direction,
the uncertain light this time favouring me, and I heard their footsteps
and their curses dying away on the wrong track.&nbsp; Nevertheless I
ran on at full speed, and it was not till the day was dawning that I
began to feel safe and relax my efforts.&nbsp; The sun had been up an
hour when I reached a small town, and the little <i>locanda</i> was
just opening for the day when I entered it, thankful for a hot cup of
coffee, and a dirty little room, with a dirtier bed, where I could sleep
off the fatigue and excitement of the night.&nbsp; I was strolling down
almost the only street <!-- page 61--><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>in
the afternoon when I met a couple of carabineers riding into it, and
shortly after encountered the whole troop, to my great delight, in command
of an intimate friend whom I had left a month before in Naples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>caro mio</i>!&rdquo; he exclaimed, when he saw me,
&ldquo;well met.&nbsp; What on earth are you doing here?&mdash;looking
for those brigands you were so anxious to find when you left Naples?&nbsp;
Considering that you are in the heart of their country, you should not
have much difficulty in gratifying your curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had an adventure or two,&rdquo; I replied carelessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Indeed that is partly the reason you find me here.&nbsp; I was
just thinking how I could get safely back to Ascoli, when your welcome
escort appeared; for I suppose you are going there, and will let me
take advantage of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only too delighted; and you can tell me your adventures.&nbsp;
Let us dine together tonight, and I will find you a horse to ride on
with us in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am afraid my account of the episode with which I have acquainted
the reader was not strictly accurate in all its details, as I did not
wish to bring down my military friends on <!-- page 62--><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>poor
Valeria, so I skipped all allusion to her and my detention in her home;
merely saying that I had had a scuffle with brigands, and had been fortunate
enough to escape under cover of the night.&nbsp; As we passed it next
morning I recognised the path which led up to Valeria&rsquo;s cottage,
and shortly after observed that young woman herself coming up the glen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holloa!&rdquo; I said, with great presence of mind as she
drew near, &ldquo;my lovely model, I declare!&nbsp; Just you ride on,
old fellow, while I stop and ask her when she can come and sit to me
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You artists are sad rogues,&mdash;what chances your profession
must give you!&rdquo; remarked my companion, as he cast an admiring
glance on Valeria, and rode discreetly on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to be afraid of, lovely Valeria,&rdquo; I
said in a low tone, as I lingered behind; &ldquo;be sure I will never
betray either you or your rascally&mdash;hem!&nbsp; I mean your excellent
Croppo.&nbsp; By the way, was that man much hurt that I was obliged
to trip up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt!&nbsp; Santa Maria, he is dead, with a bullet through
his heart.&nbsp; Croppo says it must have been magic; for he had searched
<!-- page 63--><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>you, and he knew you
were not armed, and he was within a hundred yards of you when poor Pippo
fell, and he heard no sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Croppo is not far wrong,&rdquo; I said, glad of the opportunity
thus offered of imposing on the ignorance and credulity of the natives.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He seemed surprised that he could not frighten me the other night.&nbsp;
Tell him he was much more in my power than I was in his, dear Valeria,&rdquo;
I added, looking tenderly into her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
want to alarm you, that was the reason I let him off so easily; but
I may not be so merciful next time.&nbsp; Now, sweetest, that kiss you
owe me, and which the wall prevented your giving me the other night.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She held up her face with the innocence of a child, as I stooped from
my saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never see you again, Signer Inglese,&rdquo; she said,
with a sigh; &ldquo;for Croppo says it is not safe, after what happened
the night before last, to stay another hour.&nbsp; Indeed he went off
yesterday, leaving me orders to follow to-day; but I went first to put
your sketch-book under the bush where the donkey fell, and where you
will find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took us another minute or two to part <!-- page 64--><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>after
this; and when I had ridden away I turned to look back, and there was
Valeria gazing after me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Positively,&rdquo; I reflected,
&ldquo;I am over head and ears in love with the girl, and I believe
she is with me.&nbsp; I ought to have nipped my feelings in the bud
when she told me she was his wife; but then he is a brigand, who threatened
both my ears and my tongue, to say nothing of my life.&nbsp; To what
extent is the domestic happiness of such a ruffian to be respected?&rdquo;
and I went on splitting the moral straws suggested by this train of
thought, until I had recovered my sketch-book and overtaken my escort,
with whom I rode triumphantly back into Ascoli, where my absence had
been the cause of much anxiety, and my fate was even then being eagerly
discussed.&nbsp; My friends with whom I usually sat round the chemist&rsquo;s
door, were much exercised by the reserve which I manifested in reply
to the fire of cross-examination to which I was subjected for the next
few days; and English eccentricity, which was proverbial even in this
secluded town, received a fresh illustration in the light and airy manner
with which I treated a capture and escape from brigands, which I regarded
<!-- page 65--><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>with such indifference
that I could not be induced even to condescend to details.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
was a mere scuffle; there were only four; and, being an Englishman,
I polished them all off with the &lsquo;box,&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;and
I closed my fist, and struck a scientific attitude of self-defence,
branching off into a learned disquisition on the pugilistic art, which
filled my hearers with respect and amazement.&nbsp; From this time forward
the sentiment with which I regarded my air-gun underwent a change.&nbsp;
When a friend had made me a present of it a year before, I regarded
it in the light of a toy, and rather resented the gift as too juvenile.&nbsp;
I wonder he did not give me a kite or a hoop, I mentally reflected.&nbsp;
Then I had found it useful among Italians, who are a trifling people,
and like playthings; but now that it had saved my life, and sent a bullet
through a man&rsquo;s heart, I no longer entertained the same feeling
of contempt for it.&nbsp; Not again would I make light of it,&mdash;this
potent engine of destruction which had procured me the character of
being a magician.&nbsp; I would hide it from human gaze, and cherish
it as a sort of fetish.&nbsp; So I bought a walking-stick and an umbrella,
and strapped it up with them, wrapped in my <!-- page 66--><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>plaid;
and when, shortly after, an unexpected remittance from an aunt supplied
me with money enough to buy a horse from one of the officers of my friend&rsquo;s
regiment, which soon after arrived, I accepted their invitation to accompany
them on their brigand-hunting expeditions, not one of them knew that
I had such a weapon as an air-gun in my possession.</p>
<p>Our <i>modus operandi</i> on these occasions was as follows: On receiving
information from some proprietor that the brigands were threatening
his property,&mdash;it was impossible to get intelligence from the peasantry,
for they were all in league with the brigands; indeed they all took
a holiday from regular work, and joined a band for a few weeks from
time to time,&mdash;we proceeded, with a force sufficiently strong to
cope with the supposed strength of the band, to the farm in question.&nbsp;
The bands were all mounted, and averaged from 200 to 400 men each.&nbsp;
It was calculated that upwards of 2000 men were thus engaged in harrying
the country, and this enabled the <i>Neri</i> to talk of the king&rsquo;s
forces engaged in legitimate warfare against those of Victor Emmanuel.&nbsp;
Riding over the vast plains of <!-- page 67--><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>the
Capitanata, we would discern against the sky-outline the figure of a
solitary horseman.&nbsp; This we knew to be a picket.&nbsp; Then there
was no time to be lost, and away we would go for him helter-skelter
across the plain; he would instantly gallop in on the main body, probably
occupying a <i>masseria</i>.&nbsp; If they thought they were strong
enough, they would show fight.&nbsp; If not, they would take to their
heels in the direction of the mountains, with us in full cry after them.&nbsp;
If they were hardly pressed they would scatter, and we were obliged
to do the same, and the result would be that the swiftest horsemen might
possibly effect a few captures.&nbsp; It was an exciting species of
warfare, partaking a good deal more of the character of a hunting-field
than of cavalry skirmishing.&nbsp; Sometimes, where the ground was hilly,
we had Bersaglieri with us; and as the brigands took to the mountains,
the warfare assumed a different character.&nbsp; Sometimes, in default
of these active little troops, we took local volunteers, whom we found
a very poor substitute.&nbsp; On more than one occasion when we came
upon the brigands in a farm, they thought themselves sufficiently strong
to hold it <!-- page 68--><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>against
us, and once the cowardice of the volunteers was amusingly illustrated.&nbsp;
The band was estimated at about 200, and we had 100 volunteers and a
detachment of 50 cavalry.&nbsp; On coming under the fire of the brigands,
the cavalry captain, who was in command, ordered the volunteers to charge,
intending when they had dislodged the enemy to ride him down on the
open; but the volunteer officer did not repeat the word, and stood stock-still,
his men all imitating his example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charge!&nbsp; I say,&rdquo; shouted the cavalry captain; &ldquo;why
don&rsquo;t you charge?&nbsp; I believe you&rsquo;re afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>E vero</i>,&rdquo; said the captain of volunteers, shrugging
his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, take my horse&mdash;you&rsquo;re only fit to be a groom;
and you, men, dismount and let these cowards hold your horses, while
you follow me,&rdquo;&mdash;and jumping from his horse, the gallant
fellow, followed by his men, charged the building, from which a hot
fire was playing upon them, sword in hand.&nbsp; In less than a quarter
of an hour the brigands were scampering, some on foot and some on horseback,
out of the farm-buildings, followed by a few <!-- page 69--><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>stray
and harmless shots from such of the volunteers as had their hands free.&nbsp;
We lost three men killed and five wounded in this little skirmish, and
killed six of the brigands, besides making a dozen prisoners.&nbsp;
When I say we, I mean my companions; for having no weapon, I had discreetly
remained with the volunteers.&nbsp; The scene of this gallant exploit
was on the classic battle-field of Cann&aelig;.&nbsp; This captain,
who was not the friend I had joined the day after my brigand adventure,
was a most plucky and dashing cavalry officer, and was well seconded
by his men, who were all Piedmontese, and of very different temperament
from the Neapolitans.&nbsp; On one occasion a band of 250 brigands waited
for us on the top of a small hill, never dreaming that we should charge
up it with the odds five to one against us&mdash;but we did; and after
firing a volley at us, which emptied a couple of saddles, they broke
and fled when we were about twenty yards from them.&nbsp; Then began
one of the most exciting scurries across country it was ever my fortune
to be engaged in.&nbsp; The brigands scattered&mdash;so did we; and
I found myself with two troopers in chase of a pair of bandits, one
of whom seemed to be the <!-- page 70--><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>chief
of the band.&nbsp; A small stream wound through the plain, which we
dashed across.&nbsp; Just beyond was a tributary ditch, which would
have been considered a fair jump in the hunting-field: both brigands
took it in splendid style.&nbsp; The hindmost was not ten yards ahead
of the leading trooper, who came a cropper, on which the brigand reined
up, fired a pistol-shot into the prostrate horse and man, and was off:
but the delay cost him dear.&nbsp; The other trooper, who was a little
ahead of me, got safely over.&nbsp; I followed suit.&nbsp; In another
moment he had fired his carbine into the brigand&rsquo;s horse, and
down they both came by the run.&nbsp; We instantly reined up, for I
saw there was no chance of overtaking the remaining brigand, and the
trooper was in the act of cutting down the man as he struggled to his
feet, when to my horror I recognised the lovely features of&mdash;Valeria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, man!&rdquo; I shouted, throwing myself from my horse;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a woman! touch her if you dare!&rdquo; and then seeing
the man&rsquo;s eye gleam with indignation, I added, &ldquo;Brave soldiers,
such as you have proved yourself to be, do not kill women; though your
traducers say you do, do not give them cause to speak <!-- page 71--><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>truth.&nbsp;
I will be responsible for this woman&rsquo;s safety.&nbsp; Here, to
make it sure, you had better strap us together.&rdquo;&nbsp; I piqued
myself exceedingly on this happy inspiration, whereby I secured an arm-in-arm
walk, of a peculiar kind it is true, with Valeria, and indeed my readiness
to sacrifice myself seemed rather to astonish the soldier, who hesitated.&nbsp;
However, his comrade, whose horse had been shot in the ditch, now came
up, and seconded my proposal, as I offered him a mount on mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How on earth am I to let you escape, dear Valeria?&rdquo;
I whispered, giving her a sort of affectionate nudge: the position of
our arms prevented my squeezing hers, as I could have wished, and the
two troopers kept behind us, watching us, I thought, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite impossible now&mdash;don&rsquo;t attempt it,&rdquo;
she answered; &ldquo;perhaps there may be an opportunity later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that Croppo who got away?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp;
He could not get his cowardly men to stand on that hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a bother those men are behind, dearest!&nbsp; Let me
pretend to scratch my nose with this hand that is tied to yours, which
I can thus bring to my lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 72--><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>I accomplished this
man&oelig;uvre rather neatly, but parties now came straggling in from
other directions, and I was obliged to give up whispering and become
circumspect.&nbsp; They all seemed rather astonished at our group, and
the captain laughed heartily as he rode up and called out, &ldquo;Who
have you got tied to you there, <i>caro mio</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Croppo&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; I had her tied to me for fear she
should escape; besides, she is not bad-looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a prize!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have made
a tolerable haul this time,&mdash;twenty prisoners in all&mdash;among
them the priest of the band.&nbsp; Our colonel has just arrived, so
I am in luck&mdash;he will be delighted.&nbsp; See, the prisoners are
being brought up to him now: but you had better remount and present
yours in a less singular fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we reached the colonel we found him examining the priest.&nbsp;
His breviary contained various interesting notes, written on some of
the fly-leaves.&nbsp; For instance:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Administered extreme unction to A---, shot by Croppo&rsquo;s
orders: my share ten <i>scudi</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 73--><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>&ldquo;Ditto, ditto,
to R---, hung by Croppo&rsquo;s order; my share two <i>scudi</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditto, ditto, to S---, roasted by Croppo&rsquo;s order, to
make him name an agent to bring his ransom: overdone by mistake, and
died&mdash;so got nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditto, ditto, to P---, executed by the knife by Croppo&rsquo;s
order, for disobedience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M--- and F---, and D---, three new members, joined to-day:
confessed them, and received the usual fees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a dark, beetle-browed-looking ruffian, this holy man; and
the colonel, when he had finished examining his book of prayer and crime,
tossed it to me, saying,&mdash;&ldquo;There! that will show your friends
in England the kind of politicians we make war against.&nbsp; Ha! what
have we here?&nbsp; This is more serious.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he unfolded
a piece of paper which had been concealed in the breast of the priest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This contains a little valuable information,&rdquo; he added,
with a grim smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody like priests and women for carrying
about political secrets, so you may have made a valuable capture,&rdquo;
and he turned to where I stood with Valeria; &ldquo;let her be carefully
searched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the colonel was a very pompous man, <!-- page 74--><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>and
the document he had just discovered on the priest added to his sense
of self-importance.&nbsp; When, therefore, a large, carefully folded
paper was produced from the neighbourhood of Valeria&rsquo;s lovely
bosom, his eyes sparkled with anticipation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, as he clutched it eagerly, &ldquo;the plot is thickening!&rdquo;
and he spread out triumphantly, before he had himself seen what it was,
the exquisitely drawn portrait of a donkey.&nbsp; There was a suppressed
titter, which exploded into a shout when the bystanders looked into
the colonel&rsquo;s indignant face.&nbsp; I only was affected differently,
as my gaze fell upon this touching evidence of dear Valeria&rsquo;s
love for me, and I glanced at her tenderly.&nbsp; &ldquo;This has a
deeper significance than you think for,&rdquo; said the colonel, looking
round angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Croppo&rsquo;s wife does not carefully secrete
a drawing like that on her person for nothing.&nbsp; See, it is done
by no common artist.&nbsp; It means something, and must be preserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have a Biblical reference to the state of Italy.&nbsp;
You remember Issachar was likened to an ass between two burdens.&nbsp;
In that case it probably emanated from Rome,&rdquo; <!-- page 75--><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>I
remarked; but nobody seemed to see the point of the allusion, and the
observation fell flat.</p>
<p>That night I dined with the colonel, and after dinner I persuaded
him to let me visit Valeria in prison, as I wished to take the portrait
of the wife of the celebrated brigand chief.&nbsp; I thanked my stars
that my friend who had seen her when we met in the glen, was away on
duty with his detachment, and could not testify to our former acquaintance.&nbsp;
My meeting with Valeria on this occasion was too touching and full of
tender passages to be of any general interest.&nbsp; Valeria told me
that she was still a bride; that she had only been married a few months,
and that she had been compelled to become Croppo&rsquo;s wife against
her choice, as the brigand&rsquo;s will was too powerful to be resisted;
but that, though he was jealous and attached to her, he was stern and
cruel, and so far from winning her love since her marriage, he had rather
estranged it by his fits of passion and ferocity.&nbsp; As may be imagined,
the portrait, which was really very successful, took some time in execution,
the more especially as we had to discuss the possibilities of Valeria&rsquo;s
escape.</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>&ldquo;We are going
to be transferred to-morrow to the prison at Foggia,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If, while we were passing through the market-place, a disturbance
of some sort could be created, as it is market day, and all the country
people know me, and are my friends, a rescue might be attempted.&nbsp;
I know how to arrange for that, only they must see some chance of success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bright thought suddenly struck me; it was suggested by a trick
I had played shortly after my arrival in Italy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I am something of a magician, Valeria; you have had
proof of that.&nbsp; If I create a disturbance by magic to-morrow, when
you are passing through the market-place, you won&rsquo;t stay to wonder
what is the cause of the confusion, but instantly take advantage of
it to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me for that, <i>caro mio</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you escape, when shall we meet again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am known too well now to risk another meeting.&nbsp; I shall
be in hiding with Croppo, where it will be impossible for you to find
me, nor while he lives could I ever dare to think of leaving him; but
I shall never forget <!-- page 77--><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>you&rdquo;&mdash;and
she pressed my hands to her lips&mdash;&ldquo;though I shall no longer
have the picture of the donkey to remember you by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, here&rsquo;s my photograph; that will be better,&rdquo;
said I, feeling a little annoyed&mdash;foolishly, I admit.&nbsp; Then
we strained each other to our respective hearts, and parted.&nbsp; Now
it so happened that my room in the <i>locanda</i> in which I was lodging
overlooked the market-place.&nbsp; Here at ten o&rsquo;clock in the
morning I posted myself&mdash;for that was the hour, as I had been careful
to ascertain, when the prisoners were to start for Foggia.&nbsp; I opened
the window about three inches, and fixed it there: I took out my gun,
put eight balls in it, and looked down upon the square.&nbsp; It was
crowded with the country people in their bright-coloured costumes, chaffering
over their produce.&nbsp; I looked above them to the tall campanile
of the church which filled one side of the square.&nbsp; I receded a
step and adjusted my gun on the ledge of the window to my entire satisfaction.&nbsp;
I then looked down the street in which the prison was situated, and
which debouched on the square, and awaited events.&nbsp; At ten minutes
past ten I saw the soldiers at the door of the <!-- page 78--><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>prison
form up, and then I knew that the twenty prisoners of whom they formed
the escort were starting; but the moment they began to move, I fired
at the big bell in the campanile, which responded with a loud clang.&nbsp;
All the people in the square looked up.&nbsp; As the prisoners entered
the square, which they had to cross in its whole breadth, I fired again
and again.&nbsp; The bell banged twice, and the people began to buzz
about.&nbsp; Now, I thought, I must let the old bell have it.&nbsp;
By the time five more balls had struck the bell with a resounding din,
the whole square was in commotion.&nbsp; A miracle was evidently in
progress, or the campanile was bewitched.&nbsp; People began to run
hither and thither; all the soldiers forming the escort gaped open-mouthed
at the steeple as the clangour continued.&nbsp; As soon as the last
shot had been fired, I looked down into the square and saw all this,
and I saw that the prisoners were attempting to escape, and in more
than one instance had succeeded, for the soldiers began to scatter in
pursuit, and the country people to form themselves into impeding crowds,
as though by accident, but nowhere could I see Valeria.&nbsp; When I
was quite sure she had escaped, I <!-- page 79--><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>went
down and joined the crowd.&nbsp; I saw three prisoners captured and
brought back; and when I asked the officer in command how many had escaped,
he said three&mdash;Croppo&rsquo;s wife, the priest, and another.</p>
<p>When I met my cavalry friends at dinner that evening, it was amusing
to hear them speculate upon the remarkable occurrence which had, in
fact, upset the wits of the whole town.&nbsp; Priests and vergers and
sacristans had visited the campanile, and one of them had brought away
a flattened piece of lead, which looked as if it might have been a bullet;
but the suggestion that eight bullets could have hit the bell in succession
without anybody hearing a sound, was treated with ridicule.&nbsp; I
believe the bell was subsequently exorcised with holy water.&nbsp; I
was afraid to remain with the regiment with my air-gun after this, lest
some one should discover it, and unravel the mystery; besides, I felt
a sort of traitor to the brave friends who had so generously offered
me their hospitality, so I invented urgent private affairs, which demanded
my immediate return to Naples, and on the morning of my departure found
myself embraced by all the officers of the regiment, <!-- page 80--><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>from
the colonel downwards, who, in the fervour of their kisses, thrust sixteen
waxed moustache-points against my cheeks.</p>
<p>About eighteen months after this, I heard of the capture and execution
of Croppo, and I knew that Valeria was free; but I had unexpectedly
inherited a property, and was engaged to be married.&nbsp; I am now
a country gentleman with a large family.&nbsp; My sanctum is stocked
with various mementoes of my youthful adventures, but none awakens in
me such thrilling memories as are excited by the breviary of the brigand
priest, and the portrait of the brigand&rsquo;s bride.</p>
<h2><!-- page 81--><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>THE SISTERS OF
THIBET.</h2>
<p>It is now nearly twenty-seven years ago&mdash;long before the Theosophical
Society was founded, or Esoteric Buddhism was known to exist in the
form recently revealed to us by Mr Sinnett<a name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81">{81}</a>&mdash;that
I became the <i>chela</i>, or pupil, of an adept of Buddhist occultism
in Khatmandhu.&nbsp; At that time Englishmen, unless attached to the
Residency, were not permitted to reside in that picturesque Nepaulese
town.&nbsp; Indeed I do not think that they are now; but I had had an
opportunity during the Indian Mutiny, when I was attached to the Nepaulese
contingent, of forming an intimacy with a &ldquo;Guru&rdquo; connected
with the force.&nbsp; It was not until our acquaintance had ripened
into a warm friendship <!-- page 82--><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>that
I gradually made the discovery that this interesting man held views
which differed so widely from the popular conception of Buddhism as
I had known it in Ceylon&mdash;where I had resided for some years&mdash;that
my curiosity was roused,&mdash;the more especially as he was in the
habit of sinking off gradually, even while I was speaking to him, into
trance-conditions, which would last sometimes for a week, during which
time he would remain without food; and upon more than one occasion I
missed even his material body from my side, under circumstances which
appeared to me at the time unaccountable.&nbsp; The Nepaulese troops
were not very often engaged with the rebels during the Indian Mutiny;
but when they were, the Guru was always to be seen under the hottest
fire, and it was generally supposed by the army that his body, so far
from being impervious to bullets, was so pervious to them that they
could pass through it without producing any organic disturbance.&nbsp;
I was not aware of this fact at first; and it was not until I observed
that, while he stood directly in the line of fire, men were killed immediately
behind him, that I ceased to accompany him into <!-- page 83--><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>action,
and determined, if possible, to solve a mystery which had begun to stimulate
my curiosity to the highest pitch.&nbsp; It is not necessary for me
to enter here into the nature of the conversations I had with him on
the most important and vital points affecting universal cosmogony and
the human race and its destiny.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that they determined
me to sever my connection with the Government of India; to apply privately,
through my friend the Guru, to the late Jung Bahadoor for permission
to reside in Nepaul; and finally, in the garb of an Oriental, to take
up my residence in Khatmandhu, unknown to the British authorities.&nbsp;
I should not now venture on this record of my experiences, or enter
upon the revelation of a phase hitherto unknown and unsuspected, of
that esoteric science which has, until now, been jealously guarded as
a precious heritage belonging exclusively to regularly initiated members
of mysteriously organised associations, had not Mr Sinnett, with the
consent of a distinguished member of the Thibetan brotherhood, and,
in fact, at his dictation, let, if I may venture to use so profane an
expression in connection with such a sacred subject, <!-- page 84--><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>&ldquo;the
cat out of the bag.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since, however, the <i>arhats</i>,
or illuminati, of the East, seem to have arrived at the conclusion that
the Western mind is at last sufficiently prepared and advanced in spiritual
knowledge to be capable of assimilating the occult doctrines of Esoteric
Buddhism, and have allowed their pupil to burst them upon a thoughtless
and frivolous society with the suddenness of a bomb-shell, I feel released
from the obligations to secrecy by which I have hitherto felt bound,
and will proceed to unfold a few arcana of a far more extraordinary
character than any which are to be found even in the pages of the &lsquo;Theosophist&rsquo;
or of &lsquo;Esoteric Buddhism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owing to certain conditions connected with my <i>linga sharira</i>,
or &ldquo;astral body&rdquo;&mdash;which it would be difficult for me
to explain to those who are not to some extent initiated&mdash;I passed
through the various degrees of <i>chela</i>-ship with remarkable rapidity.&nbsp;
When I say that in less than fifteen years of spiritual absorption and
profound contemplation of esoteric mysteries I became a <i>mahatma</i>,
or adept, some idea may be formed by <i>chelas</i> who are now treading
that path of severe <!-- page 85--><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>ordeal,
of the rapidity of my progress: indeed, such extraordinary faculty did
I manifest, that at one time the Guru, my master, was inclined to think
that I was one of those exceptional cases which recur from time to time,
where a child-body is selected as the human tenement of a reincarnated
adept; and that though belonging by rights to the fourth round, I was
actually born into the fifth round of the human race in the planetary
chain.&nbsp; &ldquo;The adept,&rdquo; says an occult aphorism, &ldquo;becomes;
he is not made.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was exactly my case.&nbsp; I attribute
it principally to an overweening confidence in myself, and to a blind
faith in others.&nbsp; As Mr Sinnett very properly remarks&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Very much further than people generally imagine,
will mere confidence carry the occult neophyte.&nbsp; How many European
readers who would be quite incredulous if told of some results which
occult <i>chelas</i> in the most incipient stages of their training
have to accomplish by sheer force of confidence, hear constantly in
church, nevertheless, the familiar Biblical assurances of the power
which resides in faith, and let the words pass by like the wind, leaving
no impression!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true that I had some reason for this confidence&mdash;which
arose from the fact that prior to my initiation into Buddhist mysteries,
<!-- page 86--><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>and before I left England,
I had developed, under the spiritual craze which was then prevalent
in society, a remarkable faculty of clairvoyance.&nbsp; This gave me
the power not merely of diagnosing the physical and moral conditions
of my friends and acquaintances, and of prescribing for them when necessary,
but of seeing what was happening in other parts of the world; hence
my organism was peculiarly favourable for initiation into occult mysteries,
and naturally&mdash;or rather spiritually&mdash;prepared for that method
in the regular course of occult training by which adepts impart instruction
to their pupils.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They awaken,&rdquo; as we are most accurately
informed by Mr Sinnett, &ldquo;the dormant sense in the pupil, and through
this they imbue his mind with a knowledge that such and such a doctrine
is the real truth.&nbsp; The whole scheme of evolution infiltrates into
the regular <i>chela&rsquo;s</i> mind, by reason of the fact that he
is made to see the process taking place by clairvoyant vision.&nbsp;
There are no words used in his instruction at all.&nbsp; And adepts
themselves, to whom the facts and processes of nature are as familiar
as our five fingers to us, find it difficult to explain in a treatise
which they cannot illustrate for us, by producing mental pictures in
our dormant sixth sense, the complex anatomy of the planetary system.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have always felt&mdash;and my conviction on <!-- page 87--><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>the
subject has led to some painful discussions between myself and some
of my <i>mahatma</i> brothers&mdash;that the extreme facility with which
I was enabled to perceive at a glance &ldquo;the complex anatomy of
the planetary system,&rdquo; and the rapid development of my &ldquo;dormant
sixth sense,&rdquo; was due mainly to the fact that I was nothing more
nor less than what spiritualists call a highly sensitive medium.&nbsp;
Meantime this premature development of my sixth sense forced me right
up through the obstacles which usually impede such an operation in the
case of a fourth-round man, into that stage of evolution which awaits
the rest of humanity&mdash;or rather, so much of humanity as may reach
it in the ordinary course of nature&mdash;in the latter part of the
fifth round.&nbsp; I merely mention this to give confidence to my readers,
as I am about to describe a moral cataclysm which subsequently took
place in my sixth sense, which would be of no importance in the case
of an ordinary <i>chela</i>, but which was attended with the highest
significance as occurring to a <i>mahatma</i> who had already attained
the highest grade in the mystic brotherhood.&nbsp; It was not to be
wondered at that when I arrived at this advanced <!-- page 88--><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>condition,
Khatmandhu, though a pleasant town, was not altogether a convenient
residence for an occultist of my eminence.&nbsp; In the first place,
the streets were infested with <i>dugpas</i>, or red-caps, a heretical
sect, some members of which have <i>arhat</i> pretensions of a very
high order&mdash;indeed I am ready to admit that I have met with Shammar
adepts, who, so far as supernatural powers were concerned, were second
to none among ourselves.&nbsp; But this was only the result of that
necromancy which Buddha in his sixth incarnation denounced in the person
of Tsong-kha-pa, the great reformer.&nbsp; They even deny the spiritual
supremacy of the Dalai Lama at Lhassa, and own allegiance to an impostor
who lives at the monastery of Sakia Djong.</p>
<p>The presence of these men, and the presumption of their adepts, who
maintained that through subjective or clairvoyant conditions, which
they asserted were higher than ours, they had attained a more exalted
degree of illumination which revealed a different cosmogony from that
which has been handed down to us through countless generations of adepts,
were a perpetual annoyance to me; <!-- page 89--><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>but
perhaps not greater than the proximity of the English Resident and the
officers attached to him, the impure exhalations from whose <i>rupas</i>,
or material bodies, infected as they were with magnetic elements drawn
from Western civilisation, whenever I met them, used to send me to bed
for a week.&nbsp; I therefore strongly felt the necessity of withdrawal
to that isolated and guarded region where the most advanced adepts can
pursue their contemplative existence without fear of interruption, and
prepare their <i>karma</i>, or, in other words, the molecules of their
fifth principle, for the ineffable bliss of appropriate development
in <i>devachan</i>&mdash;a place, or rather &ldquo;state,&rdquo; somewhat
resembling Purgatory with a dash of heaven in it; or even for the still
more exquisite sensation which arises from having no sensations at all,
and which characterises <i>nirvana</i>, or a sublime condition of conscious
rest in Omniscience.</p>
<p>That I am not drawing upon my imagination in alluding to this mysterious
region, or imposing upon the credulity of my readers, I will support
my assertion by the high authority of Mr Sinnett, or rather of his Guru;
and here I may remark incidentally, <!-- page 90--><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>that
after a long experience of Gurus, I have never yet met one who would
consciously tell a lie.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From time immemorial,&rdquo; says Mr Sinnett&rsquo;s
Guru, &ldquo;there has been a certain region in Thibet, which to this
day is quite unknown to and unapproachable by any but initiated persons,
and inaccessible to the ordinary people of the country, as to any others,
in which adepts have always congregated.&nbsp; But the country generally
was not in Buddha&rsquo;s time, as it has since become, the chosen habitation
of the great brotherhood.&nbsp; Much more than they are at present,
were the <i>mahatmas</i> in former times distributed throughout the
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The progress of civilisation engendering the magnetism they
find so trying, had, however, by the date with which we are now dealing&mdash;the
fourteenth century&mdash;already given rise to a very general movement
towards Thibet on the part of the previously dissociated occultists.&nbsp;
Far more widely than was held to be consistent with the safety of mankind
was occult knowledge and power then found to be disseminated.&nbsp;
To the task of putting it under a rigid system of rule and law did Tsong-kha-pa
address himself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, before transferring my material body to this region, I
was perfectly familiar with it by reason of the faculty which, as Mr
Sinnett very truly tells us, is common to all adepts, of being able
to flit about the world at will in your astral body; and here I would
<!-- page 91--><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>remark parenthetically,
that I shall use the term &ldquo;astral body&rdquo; to save confusion,
though, as Mr Sinnett again properly says, it is not strictly accurate
under the circumstances.&nbsp; In order to make this clear, I will quote
his very lucid observations on the subject:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;During the last year or two, while hints and scraps
of occult science have been finding their way out into the world, the
expression &lsquo;astral body&rsquo; has been applied to a certain semblance
of the human form, fully inhabited by its higher principles, which can
migrate to any distance from the physical body&mdash;projected consciously
and with exact intention by a living adept, or unintentionally by the
accidental application of certain mental forces to his loosened principles
by any person at the moment of death.&nbsp; For ordinary purposes, there
is no practical inconvenience in using the expression &lsquo;astral
body&rsquo; for the appearance so projected&mdash;indeed any more strictly
accurate expression, as will be seen directly, would be cumbersome,
and we must go on using the phrase in both meanings.&nbsp; No confusion
need arise; but strictly speaking, the <i>linga sharira</i>, or third
principle, is the astral body, and that cannot be sent about as the
vehicle of the higher principles.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As, however, &ldquo;no confusion need arise&rdquo; from my describing
how I went about in my <i>linga sharira</i>, I will continue to use
it as the term for my vehicle of transportation.&nbsp; Nor need there
be any difficulty about my being in two <!-- page 92--><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>places
at once.&nbsp; I have the authority of Mr Sinnett&rsquo;s Guru for this
statement, and it is fully confirmed by my own experience.&nbsp; For
what says the Guru?&mdash;&ldquo;The individual consciousness, it is
argued, cannot be in two places at once.&nbsp; But first of all, to
a certain extent it can.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is unnecessary for me to add
a word to this positive and most correct statement; but what the Guru
has not told us is, that there is a certain discomfort attending the
process.&nbsp; Whenever I went with my astral body, or <i>linga sharira</i>,
into the mysterious region of Thibet already alluded to, leaving my
<i>rupa</i>, or natural body, in Khatmandhu, I was always conscious
of a feeling of rawness; while the necessity of looking after my <i>rupa</i>&mdash;of
keeping, so to speak, my astral eye upon it, lest some accident should
befall it, which might prevent my getting back to it, and so prematurely
terminate my physical or objective existence&mdash;was a constant source
of anxiety to me.&nbsp; Some idea of the danger which attends this process
may be gathered from the risks incidental to a much more difficult operation
which I once attempted, and succeeded, after incredible effort, in accomplishing;
this was the passage of my fifth <!-- page 93--><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>principle,
or ego-spirit, into the ineffable condition of <i>nirvana</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let it not be supposed,&rdquo; says Mr Sinnett,&mdash;for
it is not his Guru who is now speaking,&mdash;&ldquo;that for any adept
such a passage can be lightly undertaken.&nbsp; Only stray hints about
the nature of this great mystery have reached me; but, putting these
together, I believe I am right in saying that the achievement in question
is one which only some of the high initiates are qualified to attempt,
which exacts a total suspension of animation in the body for periods
of time compared to which the longest cataleptic trances known to ordinary
science are insignificant; the protection of the physical frame from
natural decay during this period by means which the resources of occult
science are strained to accomplish; and withal it is a process involving
a double risk to the continued earthly life of the person who undertakes
it.&nbsp; One of these risks is the doubt whether, when once <i>nirvana</i>
is attained, the ego will be willing to return.&nbsp; That the return
will be a terrible effort and sacrifice is certain, and will only be
prompted by the most devoted attachment, on the part of the spiritual
traveller, to the idea of duty in its purest abstraction.&nbsp; The
second great risk is that of allowing the sense of duty to predominate
over the temptation to stay&mdash;a temptation, be it remembered, that
is not weakened by the motive that any conceivable penalty can attach
to it.&nbsp; Even then it is always doubtful whether the traveller will
be able to return.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this is exactly as Mr Sinnett has described it.&nbsp; I shall
never forget the struggle <!-- page 94--><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>that
I had with my ego when, ignoring &ldquo;the idea of duty in its purest
abstraction,&rdquo; it refused to abandon the bliss of <i>nirvana</i>
for the troubles of this mundane life; or the anxiety both of my <i>manas</i>,
or human soul, and my <i>buddhi</i>, or spiritual soul, lest, after
by our combined efforts we had overcome our ego, we should not be able
to do our duty by our <i>rupa</i>, or natural body, and get back into
it.</p>
<p>Of course, my migrations to the <i>mahatma</i> region of Thibet were
accompanied by no such difficulty as this&mdash;as, to go with your
<i>linga sharira</i>, or astral body, to another country, is a very
different and much more simple process than it is to go with your <i>manas</i>,
or human soul, into <i>nirvana</i>.&nbsp; Still it was a decided relief
to find myself comfortably installed with my material body, or <i>rupa</i>,
in the house of a Thibetan brother on that sacred soil which has for
so many centuries remained unpolluted by a profane foot.</p>
<p>Here I passed a tranquil and contemplative existence for some years,
broken only by such incidents as my passage into <i>nirvana</i>, and
disturbed only by a certain subjective sensation of aching or void,
by which I was occasionally attacked, and which I was finally <!-- page 95--><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>compelled
to attribute, much to my mortification, to the absence of women.&nbsp;
In the whole of this sacred region, the name of which I am compelled
to withhold, there was not a single female.&nbsp; Everybody in it was
given up to contemplation and ascetic absorption; and it is well known
that profound contemplation, for any length of time, and the presence
of the fair sex, are incompatible.&nbsp; I was much troubled by this
vacuous sensation, which I felt to be in the highest degree derogatory
to my fifth principle, and the secret of which I discovered, during
a trance-condition which lasted for several months, to arise from a
subtle magnetism, to which, owing to my peculiar organic condition,
I was especially sensitive, and which penetrated the <i>mahatma</i>
region from a tract of country almost immediately contiguous to it in
the Karakorum Mountains, which was as jealously guarded from foreign
intrusion as our own, and which was occupied by the &ldquo;Thibetan
Sisters,&rdquo; a body of female occultists of whom the Brothers never
spoke except in terms of loathing and contempt.&nbsp; It is not, therefore,
to be wondered at that no mention is made either of them, or the lovely
highland district they occupy, in Mr Sinnett&rsquo;s <!-- page 96--><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>book.&nbsp;
The attraction of this feminine sphere became at last so overpowering,
that I determined to visit it in my astral body; and now occurred the
first of many most remarkable experiences which were to follow.&nbsp;
It is well known to the initiated, though difficult to explain to those
who are not, that in a sense space ceases to exist for the astral body.&nbsp;
When you get out of your <i>rupa</i>, you are out of space as ordinary
persons understand it, though it continues to have a certain subjective
existence.</p>
<p>I was in this condition, and travelling rapidly in the desired direction,
when I became conscious of the presence of the most exquisitely lovely
female astral body which the imagination of man could conceive; and
here I may incidentally remark, that no conception can be formed of
the beauty to which woman can attain by those who have only seen her
in her <i>rupa</i>&mdash;or, in other words, in the flesh.&nbsp; Woman&rsquo;s
real charm consists in her <i>linga sharira</i>&mdash;that ethereal
duplicate of the physical body which guides <i>jiva</i>, or the second
principle, in its work on the physical particles, and causes it to build
up the shape which these assume in the material.&nbsp; Sometimes <!-- page 97--><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>it
makes rather a failure of it, so far as the <i>rupa</i> is concerned,
but it always retains its own fascinating contour and deliciously diaphanous
composition undisturbed.&nbsp; When my gaze fell upon this most enchanting
object, or rather subject&mdash;for I was in a subjective condition
at the time&mdash;I felt all the senses appertaining to my third principle
thrill with emotion; but it seemed impossible&mdash;which will readily
be understood by the initiated&mdash;to convey to her any clear idea
of the admiration she excited, from the fact that we were neither of
us in natural space.&nbsp; Still the sympathy between our <i>linga shariras</i>
was so intense, that I perceived that I had only to go back for my <i>rupa</i>,
and travel in it to the region of the sisterhood, to recognise her in
her <i>rupa</i> at once.</p>
<p>Every <i>chela</i> even knows how impossible it is to make love satisfactorily
in nothing but your <i>linga sharira</i>.&nbsp; It is quite different
after you are dead, and have gone in your fourth principle, or <i>kama
rupa</i>, which is often translated &ldquo;body of desire,&rdquo; into
<i>devachan</i>; for, as Mr Sinnett most correctly remarks, &ldquo;The
purely sensual feelings and tastes of the late personality will drop
off from it in <i>devachan</i>; <!-- page 98--><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>but
it does not follow that nothing is preservable in that state, except
feelings and thoughts having a direct reference to religion or spiritual
philosophy.&nbsp; On the contrary, all the superior phases, even of
sensuous emotion, find their appropriate sphere of development in <i>devachan</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Until you are obliged to go to <i>devachan</i>&mdash;which, in ordinary
parlance, is the place good men go to when they die&mdash;my advice
is, stick to your <i>rupa</i>; and indeed it is the instinct of everybody
who is not a <i>mahatma</i> to do this.&nbsp; I admit&mdash;though in
making this confession I am aware that I shall incur the contempt of
all <i>mahatmas</i>&mdash;that on this occasion I found my <i>rupa</i>
a distinct convenience, and was not sorry that it was still in existence.&nbsp;
In it I crossed the neutral zone still inhabited by ordinary Thibetans,
and after a few days&rsquo; travel, found myself on the frontiers of
&ldquo;the Sisters&rsquo;&rdquo; territory.&nbsp; The question which
now presented itself was how to get in.&nbsp; To my surprise, I found
the entrances guarded not by women, as I expected, but by men.&nbsp;
These were for the most part young and handsome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you imagined,&rdquo; said one, who advanced to meet me
with an engaging air, <!-- page 99--><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>
&ldquo;that you could slip into our territory in your astral body; but
you found that all the entrances <i>in vacuo</i>&rdquo;&mdash;I use
this word for convenience&mdash;&ldquo;are as well guarded as those
in space.&nbsp; See, here is the Sister past whom you attempted to force
your way: we look after the physical frontier, and leave the astral
or spiritual to the ladies,&rdquo;&mdash;saying which he politely drew
back, and the apparition whose astral form I knew so well, now approached
in her substantial <i>rupa</i>&mdash;in fact, she was a good deal stouter
than I expected to find her; but I was agreeably surprised by her complexion,
which was much fairer than is usual among Thibetans&mdash;indeed her
whole type of countenance was Caucasian, which was not to be wondered
at, considering, as I afterwards discovered, that she was by birth a
Georgian.&nbsp; She greeted me, in the language common to all Thibetan
occultists, as an old acquaintance, and one whose arrival was evidently
expected&mdash;indeed she pointed laughingly to a bevy of damsels whom
I now saw trooping towards us, some carrying garlands, some playing
upon musical instruments, some dancing in lively measures, and singing
their songs of welcome as they drew <!-- page 100--><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>near.&nbsp;
Then Ushas&mdash;for that was the name (signifying &ldquo;The Dawn&rdquo;)
of the illuminata whose acquaintance I had first made <i>in vacuo</i>&mdash;taking
me by the hand, led me to them, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rejoice, O my sisters, at the long-anticipated arrival of
the Western <i>arhat</i>, who, in spite of the eminence which he has
attained in the mysteries of Esoteric Buddhism, and his intimate connection
during so many years with the Thibetan fraternity, has yet retained
enough of his original organic conditions to render him, even in the
isolation of (here she mentioned the region I had come from) susceptible
to the higher influence of the occult sisterhood.&nbsp; Receive him
in your midst as the <i>chela</i> of a new avatar which will be unfolded
to him under your tender guidance.&nbsp; Take him in your arms, O my
sisters, and comfort him with the doctrines of Ila, the Divine, the
Beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking me in their arms, I now found, was a mere formula or figure
of speech, and consisted only in throwing garlands over me.&nbsp; Still
I was much comforted, not merely by the grace and cordiality of their
welcome, but by the mention of Ila, whose name will <!-- page 101--><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>doubtless
be familiar to my readers as occurring in a Sanscrit poem of the age
immediately following the Vedic period, called the Satapathabrahmana,
when Manu was saved from the flood, and offered the sacrifice &ldquo;to
be the model of future generations.&rdquo;&nbsp; By this sacrifice he
obtained a daughter named Ila, who became supernaturally the mother
of humanity, and who, I had always felt, has been treated with too little
consideration by the <i>mahatmas</i>&mdash;indeed her name is not so
much as even mentioned in Mr Sinnett&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; Of course it
was rather a shock to my spiritual pride, that I, a <i>mahatma</i> of
eminence myself, should be told that I was to be adopted as a mere <i>chela</i>
by these ladies; but I remembered those beautiful lines of Buddha&rsquo;s&mdash;I
quote from memory&mdash;and I hesitated no longer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To be long-suffering and meek,<br />
To associate with the tranquil,<br />
Religious talk at due seasons;<br />
This is the greatest blessing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To be long-suffering&rdquo;&mdash;this was a virtue I should
probably have a splendid opportunity of displaying under the circumstances,&mdash;&ldquo;and
meek&rdquo;; what greater proof of meekness could <!-- page 102--><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>I
give than by becoming the <i>chela</i> of women?&nbsp; &ldquo;To associate
with the tranquil.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should certainly obey this precept,
and select the most tranquil as my associates, and with them look forward
to enjoying &ldquo;religious talk at due seasons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus
fortified by the precepts of the greatest of all teachers, my mind was
at once made up, and, lifting up my voice, I chanted, in the language
of the occult, some beautiful stanzas announcing my acceptance of their
invitation, which evidently thrilled my hearers with delight.&nbsp;
In order to save unnecessary fatigue, we now transferred ourselves through
space, and, in the twinkling of an eye, I found myself in the enchanting
abode which they called their home, or <i>dama</i>.&nbsp; Here a group
of young male <i>chelas</i> were in waiting to attend to our wants;
and the remarkable fact now struck me, that not only were all the women
lovely and the men handsome, but that no trace of age was visible on
any of them.&nbsp; Ushas smiled as she saw what was passing in my mind,
and said, without using any spoken words, for language had already become
unnecessary between us, &ldquo;This is one of the mysteries which will
be explained to you when you <!-- page 103--><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>have
reposed after the fatigues of your journey; in the meantime Asvin,&rdquo;&mdash;and
she pointed out a <i>chela</i> whose name signified &ldquo;Twilight,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;will
show you to your room.&rdquo;&nbsp; I would gladly linger, did my space
allow, over the delights of this enchanting region, and the marvellously
complete and well-organised system which prevailed in its curiously
composed society.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that in the fairy-like pavilion
which was my home, dwelt twenty-four lovely Sisters and their twenty-three
<i>chelas</i>&mdash;I was to make the twenty-fourth&mdash;in the most
complete and absolute harmony, and that their lives presented the most
charming combination of active industry, harmless gaiety, and innocent
pleasures.&nbsp; By a proper distribution of work and proportionment
of labour, in which all took part, the cultivation of the land, the
tending of the exquisite gardens, with their plashing fountains, fragrant
flowers, and inviting arbours, the herding of the cattle, and the heavier
part of various handicrafts, fell upon the men; while the women looked
after the domestic arrangements&mdash;cooked, made or mended and washed
the <i>chelas</i>&rsquo; clothes and their own (both men and women were
dressed <!-- page 104--><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>according
to the purest principles of &aelig;sthetic taste), looked after the
dairy, and helped the men in the lighter parts of their industries.</p>
<p>Various inventions, known only to the occult sisterhood by means
of their studies in the esoteric science of mechanics, contributed to
shorten these labours to an extent which would be scarcely credited
by the uninitiated; but some idea of their nature may be formed from
the fact that methods of storing and applying electricity, unknown as
yet in the West, have here been in operation for many centuries, while
telephones, flying-machines, and many other contrivances still in their
infancy with us, are carried to a high pitch of perfection.&nbsp; In
a word, what struck me at once as the fundamental difference between
this sisterhood and the fraternity of adepts with which I had been associated,
was that the former turned all their occult experiences to practical
account in their daily life in this world, instead of reserving them
solely for the subjective conditions which are supposed by <i>mahatmas</i>
to attach exclusively to another state of existence.</p>
<p>Owing to these appliances the heavy work of the day was got through
usually in time <!-- page 105--><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>for
a late breakfast, the plates and dishes being washed up and the knives
cleaned by a mechanical process scarcely occupying two minutes; and
the afternoon was usually devoted to the instruction of <i>chelas</i>
in esoteric branches of learning, and their practical application to
mundane affairs, until the cool of the evening, when parties would be
made up either for playing out-of-door games, in the less violent of
which the women took part, or in riding the beautiful horses of the
country, or in flying swiftly over its richly cultivated and variegated
surface, paying visits to other <i>damas</i> or homes, each of which
was occupied on the same scale and in the same manner as our own.&nbsp;
After a late dinner, we usually had concerts, balls, and private theatricals.</p>
<p>On the day following my arrival, Ushas explained to me the relationship
in which we were to stand towards each other.&nbsp; She said that marriage
was an institution as yet unknown to them, because their organisms had
not yet attained the conditions to which they were struggling.&nbsp;
They had progressed so far, however, that they had discovered the secret
of eternal youth.&nbsp; Indeed, Ushas herself was 590 years old.&nbsp;
I was not surprised at this, as <!-- page 106--><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>something
of the same kind has occurred more than once to <i>rishis</i> or very
advanced <i>mahatmas</i>.&nbsp; As a rule, however, they are too anxious
to go to <i>nirvana</i>, to stay on earth a moment longer than necessary,
and prefer rather to come back at intervals: this, we all know, has
occurred at least six times in the case of Buddha, as Mr Sinnett so
well explains.&nbsp; At the same time Ushas announced without words,
but with a slight blush, and a smile of ineffable tenderness, that from
the day of my birth she knew that I was destined to be her future husband,
and that at the appointed time we should be brought together.&nbsp;
We now had our period of probation to go through together, and she told
me that all the other <i>chelas</i> here were going through the necessary
training preparatory to wedlock like myself, and that there would be
a general marrying all round, when the long-expected culminating epoch
should arrive.</p>
<p>Meantime, in order to enter upon the first stage of my new <i>chela</i>-ship,
it became necessary for me to forget all the experiences which I had
acquired during the last twenty years of my life, as she explained that
it <!-- page 107--><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>would be impossible
for my mind to receive the new truths which I had now to learn so long
as I clung to what she called &ldquo;the fantasies&rdquo; of my <i>mahatma</i>-ship.&nbsp;
I cannot describe the pang which this announcement produced.&nbsp; Still
I felt that nothing must impede my search after truth; and I could not
conceal from myself that, if in winning it I also won Ushas, I was not
to be pitied.&nbsp; Nor to this day have I ever had reason to regret
the determination at which I then arrived.</p>
<p>It would be impossible for me in the compass of this article to describe
all my experiences in the new life to which I dedicated myself, nor
indeed would it be proper to do so; suffice it to say, that I progressed
beyond my Ushas&rsquo; most sanguine expectations.&nbsp; And here I
would remark, that I found my chief stimulus to exertion to be one which
had been completely wanting in my former experience.&nbsp; It consisted
simply in this, that altruism had been substituted for egotism.&nbsp;
Formerly, I made the most herculean spiritual effort to tide myself
over the great period of danger&mdash;the middle of the fifth round.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; as Mr Sinnett correctly says, &ldquo;is the stupendous
achievement of the adept as regards <!-- page 108--><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>his
own personal interests;&rdquo; and of course our own interests were
all that I or any of the other <i>mahatmas</i> ever thought of.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He has reached,&rdquo; pursues our author, &ldquo;the farther
shore of the sea in which so many of mankind will perish.&nbsp; He waits
there, in a contentment which people cannot even realise without some
glimmering of spirituality&mdash;the sixth sense&mdash;themselves, for
the arrival of his future companions.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is perfectly
true.&nbsp; I always found that the full enjoyment of this sixth sense
among <i>mahatmas</i> was heightened just in proportion to the numbers
of other people who perish, so long as you were safe yourself.</p>
<p>Here among the Sisters, on the other hand, the principle which was
inculcated was, &ldquo;Never mind if you perish yourself, so long as
you can save others;&rdquo; and indeed the whole effort was to elaborate
such a system by means of the concentration of spiritual forces upon
earth, as should be powerful enough to redeem it from its present dislocated
and unhappy condition.&nbsp; To this end had the efforts of the Sisters
been directed for so many centuries, and I had reason to believe that
the time was not far distant <!-- page 109--><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>when
we should emerge from our retirement to be the saviours and benefactors
of the whole human race.&nbsp; It followed from this, of course, that
I retained all the supernatural faculties which I had acquired as a
<i>mahatma</i>, and which I now determined to use, not for my own benefit
as formerly, but for that of my fellow-creatures, and was soon able&mdash;thanks
to additional faculties, acquired under Ushas&rsquo; tutorship&mdash;to
flit about the world in my astral body without inconvenience.</p>
<p>I happened to be in London on business the other day in this ethereal
condition, when Mr Sinnett&rsquo;s book appeared, and I at once projected
it on the astral current to Thibet.&nbsp; I immediately received a communication
from Ushas to the effect that it compelled some words of reply from
the sisterhood, and a few days since I received them.&nbsp; I regret
that it has been necessary to occupy so much of the reader&rsquo;s time
with personal details.&nbsp; They were called for in order that he should
understand the source of my information, and my peculiar qualifications
for imparting it.&nbsp; It will be readily understood, after my long
connection with the Thibetan brotherhood, how painful it must be to
me to be the <!-- page 110--><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>instrument
chosen not merely of throwing a doubt upon &ldquo;the absolute truth
concerning nature, man, the origin of the universe, and the destinies
toward which its inhabitants are tending,&rdquo; to use Mr Sinnett&rsquo;s
own words, but actually to demolish the whole structure of Esoteric
Buddhism!&nbsp; Nor would I do this now were it not that the publication
of the book called by that name has reluctantly compelled the sisterhood
to break their long silence.&nbsp; If the Thibetan Brothers had only
held their tongues and kept their secret as they have done hitherto,
they would not now be so rudely disturbed by the Thibetan Sisters.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sisters of Thibet,&rdquo; writes Ushas, of course with
an astral pen in astral ink, &ldquo;owe their origin to a circumstance
which occurred in the time of Sankaracharya, erroneously supposed by
the initiated to be an incarnation of Buddha.&nbsp; This teacher, who
lived more than a century before the Christian era, dwelt chiefly upon
the necessity of pursuing <i>gnyanam</i> in order to obtain <i>moksha</i>&mdash;that
is to say, the importance of secret knowledge to spiritual progress,
and the consummation <!-- page 111--><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>thereof.&nbsp;
And he even went so far as to maintain that a man ought to keep all
such knowledge secret from his wife.&nbsp; Now the wife of Sankaracharya,
whose name was Nandana, &lsquo;she who rejoices,&rsquo; was a woman
of very profound occult attainments; and when she found that her husband
was acquiring knowledges which he did not impart to her, she did not
upbraid him, but laboured all the more strenuously in her own sphere
of esoteric science, and she even discovered that all esoteric science
had a twofold element in it&mdash;masculine and feminine&mdash;and that
all discoveries of occult mysteries engaged in by man alone, were, so
to speak, lop-sided, and therefore valueless.&nbsp; So she conveyed
herself secretly, by processes familiar to her, away from her husband,
and took refuge in this region of Thibet in which we now dwell, and
which, with all his knowledges, Sankaracharya was never able to discover,
for they were all subjective, and dealt not with the material things
of this world.&nbsp; And she associated herself here in the pursuit
of knowledge with a learned man called Svasar, &lsquo;he who is friendly,&rsquo;
who considered secret knowledge merely the means to an end, and even
spiritual <!-- page 112--><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>progress
valuable only in so far as it could be used to help others; and they
studied deep mysteries as brother and sister together&mdash;and he had
been a <i>mahatma</i> or <i>rishi</i> of the highest grade&mdash;and,
owing to the aid he derived from his female associate, he discovered
that the subjective conditions of <i>nirvana</i> and <i>devachan</i>
were the result of one-sided male imaginings which had their origin
in male selfishness; and this conviction grew in him in the degree in
which the Parthivi Mutar, or &lsquo;Earth Mother,&rsquo; became incarnated
in Nandana.&nbsp; Thus was revealed to him the astounding fact that
the whole system of the occult adepts had originated in the natural
brains of men who had given themselves up to egotistical transcendental
speculation&mdash;in fact, I cannot better describe the process than
in the words of Mr Sinnett himself, where he alludes to &lsquo;the highly
cultivated devotees to be met with occasionally in India, who build
up a conception of nature, the universe and God, entirely on a metaphysical
basis, and who have evolved their systems by sheer force of transcendental
thinking&mdash;who will take some established system of philosophy as
its groundwork, and <!-- page 113--><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>amplify
on this to an extent which only an oriental metaphysician could dream
of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, Mr Sinnett chooses to assume, was not the fact with
the Thibet Brothers; but, in reality, this was just what they did.&nbsp;
The fact that they have outstripped other similar transcendentalists
is due to the circumstance that the original founders of the system
were men of more powerful will and higher attainments than any who have
succeeded them.&nbsp; And on their death they formed a compact spiritual
society in the other world, impregnating the wills and imaginations
of their disciples still on earth with their fantastic theories, which
they still retain there, of a planetary chain, and the spiral advance
of the seven rounds, and the septenary law, and all the rest of it.&nbsp;
In order for human beings to come into these occult knowledges, it is
necessary, as Mr Sinnett admits, for the adepts to go into trance-conditions&mdash;in
other words, to lose all control of their normal, or as they would probably
call them, their objective faculties.&nbsp; While in this condition,
they are the sport of any invisible intelligences that choose to play
upon them; but fearing lest they may be accused of this, they <!-- page 114--><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>erroneously
assert that no such intelligences of a high order have cognisance of
what happens in this world.&nbsp; The fact that <i>mahatmas</i> have
powers which appear supernatural proves nothing, as Mr Sinnett also
admits that innumerable <i>fakirs</i> and <i>yojis</i> possess these
as well, whose authority on occultism he deems of no account, when he
says that &lsquo;careless inquirers are very apt to confound such persons
with the great adepts of whom they vaguely hear.&rsquo;&nbsp; There
can be no better evidence of the falsity of the whole conception than
you are yourself.&nbsp; For to prove to you that you were the sport
of a delusion, although your own experience as a <i>mahatma</i> in regard
to the secret processes of nature, and the sensations attendant upon
subjective conditions, exactly corresponded to those of all other <i>mahatmas</i>,
you have, under my tutelage, at various times allowed yourself to fall
into trance-conditions, when, owing to occult influences which we have
brought to bear, a totally different idea concerning &lsquo;nature,
man, the origin of the universe, and the destinies toward which its
inhabitants are tending,&rsquo; was presented to your sixth sense, which
appeared &lsquo;absolute <!-- page 115--><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>truth&rsquo;
at the time, and which would have continued to seem so, had I not had
the power of intromitting you through trance-conditions into a totally
different set of apparent truths on the same subject, which were no
more to be relied upon than the other.&nbsp; The fact is, that no seer,
be he Hindoo, Buddhist, Christian, or of any other religion, is to be
depended upon the moment he throws himself into abnormal organic conditions.&nbsp;
We see best, as you have now learnt, into the deepest mysteries with
all our senses about us.&nbsp; And the discovery of this great fact
was due to woman; and it is for this reason that <i>mahatmas</i> shrink
from female <i>chelas</i>&mdash;they are afraid of them.&nbsp; According
to their philosophy, women play a poor part in the system of the universe,
and their chances of reaching the blissful condition of <i>nirvana</i>
are practically not to be compared with those of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no such thing as subjectivity apart from objectivity.&nbsp;
Mr Sinnett very properly tells you &lsquo;that occult science regards
force and matter as identical, and that it contemplates no principle
in nature as wholly immaterial.&nbsp; The clue to the mystery <!-- page 116--><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>involved,&rsquo;
he goes on to say, &lsquo;lies in the fact, directly cognisable by occult
experts, that matter exists in other states than those which are cognisable
by the five senses;&rsquo; but it does not become only cognisable subjectively
on that account.&nbsp; You know very well, as an old <i>mahatma</i>,
that you can cognise matter now with your sixth sense as well as with
your five while in a perfectly normal condition, that you could not
cognise except in trance-conditions before, and which even then you
could only cognise incorrectly.&nbsp; The much-vaunted sixth sense of
<i>mahatmas</i> needs sharpening as much as their logic, for you can
no more separate subjectivity from objectivity than you can separate
mind from matter.&nbsp; Christians, if they desire it, have a right
to a heaven of subjective bliss, because they consider that they become
immaterial when they go there; but Buddhists, who admit that they are
in a sense material while in <i>devachan</i> or <i>nirvana</i>, and
deny that their consciousness in that condition is in the same sense
objective as well as subjective, talk sheer nonsense.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ushas
used a stronger expression here, but out of consideration for my old
<i>mahatma</i> friends, I suppress it.</p>
<p><!-- page 117--><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Devachan</i>&rsquo;,
says our Guru&mdash;speaking through his disciple in order to escape
from this dilemma&mdash;&lsquo;will seem as real as the chairs and tables
round us; and remember that above all things, to the profound philosophy
of occultism, are the chairs and tables, and the whole objective scenery
of the world, unreal and merely transitory delusions of sense.&rsquo;&nbsp;
If, as he admits, they are material, why should they be more unreal
than the chairs and tables in <i>devachan</i>, which are also material,
since occult science contemplates no principle in nature as wholly immaterial?&nbsp;
The fact is, that there is no more unreal and transitory delusion of
sense than those &lsquo;states&rsquo; known to the adepts as <i>devachan</i>
or <i>nirvana</i>; they are mere dreamlands, invented by metaphysicians,
and lived in by them after death&mdash;which are used by them to encourage
a set of dreamers here to evade the practical duties which they owe
to their fellow-men in this world.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hence it is possible,&rsquo;
says our author, &lsquo;for yet living persons to have visions of <i>devachan</i>,
though such visions are rare and only one-sided, the entities in <i>devachan</i>,
sighted by the earthly clairvoyant, being quite unconscious themselves
of undergoing <!-- page 118--><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>such
observation.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is an erroneous and incorrect assumption
on the Guru&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; &lsquo;The spirit of the clairvoyant,&rsquo;
he goes on, &lsquo;ascends into the condition of <i>devachan</i> in
such rare visions, and thus becomes subject to the vivid delusions of
that existence.&rsquo;&nbsp; Vivid delusions indeed, the fatal consequences
of which are, that they separate their votaries from the practical duties
of life, and create a class of idle visionaries who, wrapping themselves
in their own vain conceits, would stand by and allow their fellow-creatures
to starve to death, because, as Mr Sinnett frankly tells us, &lsquo;if
spiritual existence, vivid subjective consciousness, really does go
on for periods greater than the periods of intellectual physical existence,
in the ratio, as we have seen in discussing the devachanic condition,
of 80 to 1 at least, then surely man&rsquo;s subjective existence is
more important than his physical existence and intellect in error, when
all its efforts are bent on the amelioration of the physical existence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the ingenious theory which the Brothers of Thibet
have devised to release them from acknowledging that they have any other
Brothers in this world to whom they <!-- page 119--><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>are
under sacred obligations besides themselves, and which, owing to the
selfish principle that underlies it, has a tendency to sap the foundations
of all morality.&nbsp; So that we have this nineteenth-century apostle
of Esoteric Buddhism venturing to assert to his Western readers that
&lsquo;it is not so rough a question as that&mdash;whether man be wicked
or virtuous&mdash;which must really, at the final critical turning-point,
decide whether he shall continue to live and develop into higher phases
of existence, or cease to live altogether.&rsquo;&nbsp; We, the Sisters
of Thibet, repudiate and denounce in the strongest terms any such doctrine
as the logical outcome either of the moral precepts of Buddha or of
the highest esoteric science.&nbsp; Let the Brothers of Thibet beware
of any longer cherishing the delusion that the Sisters of Thibet, because
their existence is purely objective, &lsquo;are therefore unreal and
merely transitory delusions of sense.&rsquo;&nbsp; We also have a secret
to reveal&mdash;the result of twenty centuries of occult learning&mdash;and
we formally announce to you, the so-called adepts of occult science,
that if you persist in disseminating any more of your deleterious metaphysical
compounds in this <!-- page 120--><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>world
under the name of Esoteric Buddhism, we will not only no longer refrain,
as we have hitherto done, from tormenting you in your subjective conditions
while still in your <i>rupas</i>, but, by virtue of the occult powers
we possess, will poison the elements of <i>devachan</i> until subjective
existence becomes intolerable there for your fifth and sixth principles,&mdash;your
<i>manas</i> and your <i>buddhis</i>,&mdash;and <i>nirvana</i> itself
will be converted into hell.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Scene I.&mdash;A railway carriage.&nbsp; The Earl and Countess of
Gules&mdash;Lady Elaine Bendore&mdash;The Hon. Adolphus Gresham.</h3>
<p><i>Elaine</i>.&nbsp; I must really beg of you to stop, Mr Gresham.&nbsp;
You cannot think how you pain and surprise me.&nbsp; I am sure I never
had the least idea!&nbsp; Besides, supposing papa or mamma should hear
you.</p>
<p><i>Adolphus</i>.&nbsp; Lord Gules is asleep, and her ladyship is
absorbed in her novel; besides, <!-- page 122--><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>you
may be sure that I have taken care to ascertain their sentiments before
I venture to say what I have to you.&nbsp; Oh, Elaine, if I could but
hope!</p>
<p><i>Train stops</i>.&nbsp; <i>Guard</i> [<i>looking in</i>].&nbsp;
All the smoking-carriages are engaged, gentlemen; but you&rsquo;ll find
room in here.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> Adolphus Plumper <i>and</i> Mr Flamm.&nbsp; Flamm <i>seats
himself opposite</i> Elaine, <i>and</i> Plumper <i>opposite</i> Adolphus.</p>
<p><i>Flamm</i> [<i>aside to</i> Plumper].&nbsp; By Jove, Plumper! you
never told me you had a twin brother.&nbsp; Polish up your spectacles,
old man&mdash;you&rsquo;ve made &rsquo;em damp by that race we had to
catch the train&mdash;and look at your <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>.</p>
<p>[Plumper <i>takes off his spectacles with great deliberation, wipes
them, puts them on again, and stares at</i> Adolphus.</p>
<p><i>Plumper</i> [<i>aside</i>] <i>stammering</i>.&nbsp; Dud-dud-dud-do
you see a likeness?&nbsp; Dud-dud-dud-don&rsquo;t see it myself.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s bab-bab-bab-bald, and he&rsquo;s not sh-sh-sh-ort-sighted.</p>
<p><i>Fl</i>.&nbsp; Probably he doesn&rsquo;t stammer either.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll try presently.&nbsp; Positively, if he wore spectacles and
a wig of your hair, I shouldn&rsquo;t know you apart.</p>
<p><!-- page 123--><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span><i>Lady Gules</i>
[<i>aside to</i> Elaine].&nbsp; Did you ever see anything more extraordinary,
my dear?&nbsp; What a horrid caricature of our dear Adolphus Gresham!</p>
<p><i>El</i>. [<i>aside</i>].&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say I agree with you,
mamma.&nbsp; I think he has a more intelligent expression&mdash;more
soul, I should say.</p>
<p><i>Lady G</i>.&nbsp; You are quite ridiculous, Elaine.&nbsp; Half
the girls in London have bean setting their caps at Mr Gresham for the
last few seasons, till they have given him up as invulnerable; and now
that you have a chance of becoming one of the richest peeresses in England,
you do nothing but snub him.&nbsp; He is as clever and charming as he
will be rich when his father dies, and is certain to become a Cabinet
Minister some day.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s considered the most rising young
man of his party.</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; That he may easily be, considering he is a Conservative.&nbsp;
Oh, mamma! how can you suppose that I would ever marry a Conservative?</p>
<p><i>Lady G</i>.&nbsp; I have no patience with you, Elaine; a nice
mess your Radicals have made of it with Egypt and Ireland.&nbsp; But
we won&rsquo;t go into that now; only remember this, if he proposes,
and you don&rsquo;t accept <!-- page 124--><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>him,
your father and I will be seriously displeased.</p>
<p><i>El</i>. [<i>sighing</i>].&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure the gentleman opposite
is a friend of the people.&nbsp; See! he&rsquo;s reading the &lsquo;Pall
Mall.&rsquo;&nbsp; [<i>Aside to</i> Adolphus.] Mamma has just been telling
me that she sees such a strange likeness between you and your opposite
neighbour.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Plumper&mdash;if the name on his hat-box
is to be believed; A. Plumper, too.&nbsp; I wonder whether A. stands
for Adolphus?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t feel flattered.</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Now that is nothing but Tory prejudice.&nbsp; I
am sure he looks very distinguished, though his name is Plumper.&nbsp;
I have no doubt he&rsquo;s a self-made man.</p>
<p><i>Pl</i>.&nbsp; Pup-pup-pup-pardon me, madam; shall I put the window
up?&nbsp; I see you feel the dud-dud-dud-draught.</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; No; I prefer it open.&nbsp; But
may I ask you to lend me your &lsquo;Echo&rsquo;? it&rsquo;s a paper
I like so much, and so seldom see.</p>
<p><i>Fl</i>.&nbsp; Cheap, but not nasty; enjoys a vast circulation
among the middle classes.&nbsp; The Conservatives are as far behind
us in journalistic capacity as they are in parliamentary eloquence.</p>
<p><!-- page 125--><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span><i>Pl</i>.&nbsp;
You must make allowances for my friend.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s on the pup-pup-pup-press
himself, and expects shortly to get into Pup-pup-pup-Parliament.</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Oh, I do so hope he will!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
think there is a reaction setting in, do you?&nbsp; Papa says that Mr
Gladstone is losing his hold on the country.</p>
<p><i>Lord Gules</i> [<i>awaking with a snort</i>].&nbsp; Not, however,
before the country has lost its hold upon him.&nbsp; He cares no more
for his country, sir, than I do for the Chinese in California.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a traitor, sir, to his principles; he&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Oh, papa, do stop!&mdash;here we are at the Victoria&mdash;and
we have no right to judge any one so harshly.&nbsp; I assure you such
strong expressions only make me feel more and more convinced how wrong
you must be.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> Plumper, <i>handing back his paper</i>.]&nbsp;
Thank you so much.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so sorry I have not had time to read
it.</p>
<p><i>Lady G</i>.&nbsp; Good-bye, Mr Gresham; remember that you have
promised to dine with us to-morrow night.&nbsp; We shall be quite alone;
but I am sure you don&rsquo;t care about a party.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; I need not say with what pleasure I shall look forward
to it.&nbsp; <i>Au revoir</i>, Lady <!-- page 126--><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Elaine.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; You do not know how you have been tempting me
to abandon all my cherished political convictions for your sake.&nbsp;
It is to be hoped that the Radicals will not follow up their success
with the caucus by organising the young ladies of their party and letting
them loose on society as propagandists of their Utopian ideas and political
fallacies.</p>
<p>[<i>Exeunt omnes</i>.</p>
<h3>SCENE II.&mdash;Lady Gules&rsquo;s Boudoir.&nbsp; Elaine and Adolphus.</h3>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; Dear Lady Elaine, Lady Gules has given me special
permission and opportunity to explain myself more fully than was possible
yesterday.&nbsp; Please tell me why you were so surprised at what I
said, and why you think me so very objectionable?</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think you at all objectionable, Mr
Gresham, as a member of society; on the contrary, I think you charming;
though I do feel that, magnetically, we are wide as the poles asunder!&nbsp;
Oh, believe me, we have no grounds of common sympathy, either in matters
of philosophical, political, or religious <!-- page 127--><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>thought&mdash;and
above all, in art!&nbsp; You seem to lack that enthusiasm for humanity
which could alone constitute an affinity between us.&nbsp; I was surprised,
because I had hoped to find in you an intelligent companion; and mortified
at the discovery that you could not rise to higher ground than that
of an ordinary admirer,&mdash;men in these days seem to think that women
have no other <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> except to be made love
to.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; I do not think that is a new idea, Lady Elaine;
but is it absolutely necessary, in order that you should return the
deep affection I feel for you, that we should agree politically, philosophically,
theologically, and &aelig;sthetically?&nbsp; In old days women did not
trouble themselves on these matters, but trusted to their hearts rather
than to their heads to guide their affections.</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; And so I do now.&nbsp; I feel instinctively that
we are not kindred spirits; that the mysterious chord of sympathy which
vibrates in the heart of a girl with the first tone of the voice of
the man she is destined to love, does not exist between us.&nbsp; Oh,
indeed, indeed, Mr Gresham, although I adore Frederic Harrison as a
thinker, as much as I dislike Mr <!-- page 128--><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>Mallock&mdash;though
I read every word he writes as a duty&mdash;I am not destitute of romance.&nbsp;
I am a profound believer in the doctrine of affinity.&nbsp; Who that
accepts, as I do, the marvellous teaching of Comte, and remembers that
the highest ideas which it contains were inspired by a woman, could
fail to be?&nbsp; But I shall know the man towards whom I am destined
to occupy the relation that Comte&rsquo;s Countess did to him, at a
glance.&nbsp; No words will need to pass between us to assure us that
we are one in sentiment.&nbsp; It will be as impossible for him to be
indifferent to elevating the taste of the masses in matters of domestic
detail, or be otherwise wanting in a whole-hearted devotion to the service
of humanity, or to scoff at the theory of evolution, as it would be
for him to accept the errors and superstitions of an obsolete theology,
or the antiquated dogmas of the Conservatives about landed property.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; And if I fulfilled all these conditions, so far
as a thorough philosophical and political sympathy was concerned, would
that avail me nothing to produce this hidden affinity?</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Absolutely nothing.&nbsp; In the first place, <!-- page 129--><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>you
could not pretend to believe and feel what you did not believe and feel;
and in the second, if you could, I should instantly sense the absence
of that internal attraction towards each other which would be irresistible
in both.&nbsp; You were right, Mr Gresham, when you said the heart and
not the head should be the guide; and I trust it absolutely&mdash;so
give up a hope which must be vain.&nbsp; Believe me, I feel deeply pained
at having to speak so decidedly, but it is better that you should be
under no delusion.&nbsp; Still, do not let me lose you as a friend whom
I shall always esteem.&nbsp; You will soon get over it, and will have
no difficulty in finding a wife who will suit you far better than I
should ever have done.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; There, believe me, you are mistaken; but it is a
point impossible to discuss.&nbsp; Good-bye, Lady Elaine.&nbsp; Thanks
for your frankness and patience with me.&nbsp; Perhaps I shall get over
it, as you say.&nbsp; I shall take refuge in my yacht, and try the curative
effect of a cruise round the world.&nbsp; It will be a year at least
before we meet again.&nbsp; [<i>Exit</i> Adolphus.</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Poor Adolphus! how absolutely impossible is love,
where the hidden sympathy of <!-- page 130--><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>soul
is wanting!&mdash;and yet how nice he is [<i>sighs</i>], and how manfully
he accepted his fate!&nbsp; What philosophy can really explain the mystery
of that magnetic affinity called love, which so unaccountably exercises
its attracting influences over the whole animal creation, and most probably
over plants?&nbsp; If it is a latent potentiality of matter, how did
it get there?&nbsp; Now for a scene with mamma.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit</i> Elaine.</p>
<h3>Scene III.&mdash;The Countess of Gules&rsquo;s Boudoir.&nbsp; Lady
Gules and Lady Elaine reading.&nbsp; Enter Charles with card and letter.</h3>
<p><i>El</i>. [<i>reading card</i>].&nbsp; Mr Adolphus Plumper!&nbsp;
Is the gentleman coming up-stairs, Charles?</p>
<p><i>Charles</i>.&nbsp; No, my lady; he only left the card and this
letter, and said he would call again. [<i>Exit</i> Charles.</p>
<p><i>El</i>. [<i>opening letter</i>].&nbsp; From Mr Gresham, mamma,
dated Naples.&nbsp; [<i>Reads</i>.]&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Elaine,</span>&mdash;I felt so much touched by the kindness of your
last words to me when we parted, that I venture to hope that it may
interest you to know, as a friend, how it has fared <!-- page 131--><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>with
me since I left England.&nbsp; The curative process does not seem to
have fairly set in yet, but I am going to try the effect of a little
mild excitement by joining the demonstrating fleets at Alexandria.&nbsp;
For a month past I have been idling here; and curiously enough, the
first person I stumbled upon in the Chiaja Gardens was Mr Adolphus Plumper&mdash;our
railway companion on the only journey I ever had the happiness to take
with you, and who seated himself by my side on a bench to which I had
resorted for a quiet cigar.&nbsp; As there are few foreigners here at
this season, we have been thrown almost daily together, and I have been
quite delighted to find how very much superior he is to what I thought
he <i>looked</i> when you honoured me by pointing out our resemblance.&nbsp;
I ought to speak highly of him, for he saved my life.&nbsp; I took him
a cruise in my yacht, and the gig in which we were landing one day was
upset in some breakers.&nbsp; I had been stunned, and should have been
drowned had he not come to the rescue; and I really feel that for this
and some other reasons which I will explain when we meet, I owe him
a debt of gratitude that I can never hope to repay.&nbsp; Although he
is <!-- page 132--><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>too retiring by
nature to say so, I could see, when I made some laughing allusions to
the occasion of our first meeting, that he would be glad to continue
to make the acquaintance of Lord and Lady Gules&mdash;in other words,
to continue the political discussion he then commenced with you.&nbsp;
Singular to state, he is an admirer of Congreve and all that school,
so I am sure you will have plenty of topics in common.&nbsp; Mr Plumper
has made an enormous fortune as a contractor, and now chiefly occupies
himself with works of charity and benevolence.&nbsp; One of his special
hobbies is the introduction of the &aelig;sthetic principle into <i>Kindergartens</i>.&nbsp;
I have given him a hint not to introduce his vulgar friend Flamm&mdash;pardon
me the expression, though he is a Radical.&nbsp; I have given Plumper
a few lines to Lady Gules.&nbsp; Please do all you can to overcome the
prejudice against him which both she and Lord Gules are sure to entertain;
and believe me, yours faithfully,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Adolphus Gresham.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><i>Lady G</i>.&nbsp; A Radical, a plutocrat, and an infidel!&nbsp;
That is a mixture that ought to suit you, Elaine.</p>
<p><!-- page 133--><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span><i>El</i>.&nbsp;
Quite as well as a Tory, a spendthrift, and a bigot, which is the one
I usually meet in society, mamma.&nbsp; But please do not let us quarrel.&nbsp;
I always try to be polite to your mixtures.&nbsp; For Mr Gresham&rsquo;s
sake, be civil to mine.</p>
<p><i>Lady G</i>.&nbsp; For Mr Gresham&rsquo;s sake, indeed!&nbsp; What
have you done for Mr Gresham&rsquo;s sake that puts me under an obligation
to him?&nbsp; However, I suppose we must ask the man to dinner.&nbsp;
Is there any address on his card?</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; 20 Heavitree Gardens.</p>
<p><i>Lady G</i>.&nbsp; One of those millionaire palaces, I suppose,
in the back regions of South Kensington.&nbsp; The carriage is waiting,
so I shall leave you to write the invitation.&nbsp; You had better ask
him for Tuesday, when we have got some people coming to dinner.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit</i> Lady Gules.</p>

One of his special hobbies is the introduction of &aelig;sthetic principles

at last who takes a living interest in the welfare of his fellow-creatures!&nbsp;
I am sure I shall like him. [ <i>Writes, and rings the bell</i>.]</p>

<h3>Scene IV.&mdash;Lady Gules&rsquo;s Boudoir.&nbsp; Lord and Lady
Gules.</h3>
<p><i>Lord G</i>.&nbsp; I tell you what it is, my dear&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
only known that fellow Plumper a month, and he has already completely
captivated Elaine with his <i>Kindergarten</i>, and his sunflowers,
and his hatred of the landed interest and Irish coercion, and love of
the <i>cl&ocirc;ture</i> and humanity, and Buddha and Brahma, and Zoroaster
and Mahomet, and all the rest of them.&nbsp; I must really take steps
to find out whether Gresham was well informed about his reputed wealth.&nbsp;
I shall ride down and take a look at 20 Heavitree Gardens to-morrow.&nbsp;
I haven&rsquo;t met a single man at the Club who has ever heard of him.</p>
<p><!-- page 135--><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span><i>Lady G</i>.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s no use: if he should turn out a pauper, or even a swindler,
I am afraid Elaine will marry him.&nbsp; I saw it in her eye last night;
and so, I should think, did he.&nbsp; He certainly can&rsquo;t complain
of not receiving encouragement.&nbsp; I only wonder that he has not
yet proposed.&nbsp; I believe the man to be capable of any act of audacity,
in spite of his languid manner, and his long hair, and short-sightedness,
and his stammer.</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> Elaine.</p>
<p><i>Lord G</i>.&nbsp; Are you coming to ride with me, or going out
to drive with your mother, Elaine?</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Neither, dear papa.&nbsp; I am too busy finishing
a paper I am writing on the &ldquo;Chiton; or, Clothing for the masses
on the principles of the ideal of the ancient Greeks,&rdquo; for the
next meeting of the Women&rsquo;s Dress Reform Association.</p>
<p><i>Lord G</i>.&nbsp; Well, take care you make them put enough on.&nbsp;
Remember the climate, if you ignore other considerations.</p>
<p><i>Lady G</i>.&nbsp; And pray do not so far overstep the bounds of
maidenly modesty as to consult your Mr Plumper on the subject.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit</i> Lord <i>and</i> Lady Gules.</p>
<p><!-- page 136--><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span><i>El</i>. [<i>sighing</i>].&nbsp;
My Mr Plumper!&nbsp; Ah, Adolphus, there is not a fibre in our bodies
or souls&mdash;and why should not souls have fibres?&mdash;that does
not vibrate in harmony!&nbsp; We are like &AElig;olian harps that make
the same music to the same airs of the affections, while electrically
our brains respond sympathetically to the same wave-current of idea.&nbsp;
Emotionally, intellectually, we are one.&nbsp; Why should I allow an
absurd custom of conventional civilisation, degrading to the sex, to
prevent my telling him so?&nbsp; What more inherent right can be vested
by nature in a woman than that of telling a man that she loves him,
and that, therefore, he belongs to her?&nbsp; Hark! his step.&nbsp;
My Adolphus!</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> Adolphus.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; I have ventured to kuk-kuk-kuk-call, Lady Elaine,
with the pap-pap-pattern I promised of female attire suited to all classes;
for why should we recognise any did-did-distinction between the folds
which drape the form of the aristocrat and the pop-pop-pauper?&nbsp;
It is all in kuk-kuk-curves and circles; there is not a straight line
about it worn thus.&nbsp; See how graciously it flows!&nbsp; <!-- page 137--><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>[<i>Puts
his head through a hole in the middle</i>.]&nbsp; But allow me; your
form will do far more justice to it than mine.&nbsp; [<i>Takes it off
and puts it on</i> Lady Elaine.]&nbsp; Ah, how divinely precious!&nbsp;
[<i>Gazes with rapture</i>.&nbsp; Lady Elaine <i>sits down in it</i>.]</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Dear Adolphus, why should this strained conventional
formality exist any longer between us?&nbsp; Can we not read each other&rsquo;s
thoughts?&nbsp; Can we not feel each other&rsquo;s hearts beating in
sweet accord?&nbsp; Are we not formed and fashioned for each other?&nbsp;
Let this exquisite garment, which we have both worn, be the symbol of
that internal robe which costumes our united souls, woven from the texture
of our affections.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>. [<i>falling on his knees, kisses its hem</i>].&nbsp; Sweet
symbol of sanctified intuitions!&nbsp; Tit-tit-tit-transparent&mdash;though
it may seem tot-tot-tolerably thick; for does it not reveal to me the
workings of the soul of my beb-beb-beloved?&nbsp; Ah, Elaine, how trifling
do earthly treasures seem, compared with those of the affections!&nbsp;
You will be mine, for ever mine, dud-dud-darling, will you not&mdash;even
though I may not have the riches I am supposed to possess?</p>
<p><!-- page 138--><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span><i>El</i>.&nbsp;
Oh, Adolphus! how can you ask me such a question?&nbsp; What is the
wealth of the pocket as compared with the wealth of the soul!</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; True! oh, quite intensely true!&mdash;for how sweetly
sings the poet Oscar on this theme!&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As like miners we explore<br />
Hidden treasures in the soul,<br />
And we pip-pip-pick the amorous ore<br />
Firmly bedded in its hole;<br />
New emotions come to light,<br />
Flashing in affections&rsquo; rays,<br />
Scintillating to the sight,<br />
With a tit-tit-tit-transcendental bib-bib-bib-blaze,<br />
Warming us until we burn<br />
With a glow of sacred fire,<br />
And as coals to diamonds turn,<br />
Sparkling in us with did-did-did-desire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Oh, quite, quite too lovely!&nbsp; Come, Adolphus&mdash;why
should we linger here, now that our troths are plighted?&nbsp; Why should
we not at once brave the world together?&nbsp; I need the sweet scents
of the air, the rustle <!-- page 139--><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>of
leaves, the singing of birds, the chattering of monkeys, and the hum
of nature.&nbsp; Let us go, my love, and walk in the Zoo.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>. [<i>rising</i>].&nbsp; Dud-dud-dud-do you intend to keep
that on?</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; What on?</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; This mystic garment of kuk-kuk-curves and circles.</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; No; I will keep it for a pattern and a sweet reminiscence.&nbsp;
Now I will go and put on my Louis Quatorze hat, and be back in a moment,
if you will go and call a hansom.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit</i> Elaine.</p>
<p>[Adolphus <i>bursts into a fit of uncontrollable laughter</i>.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit laughing</i>.</p>
<h3>Scene V.&mdash;The Zoological Gardens.</h3>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; How sweet are these sights and sounds when hallowed
by the consciousness of a beloved presence!&nbsp; How one glows with
affection towards every object in nature!&nbsp; Adolphus, dear, don&rsquo;t
you feel, with me, that our hearts warm towards the hippopotamus?</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; Mine is positively beating with the <!-- page 140--><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>violence
of my affection for him.&nbsp; If he was not so wet and bib-bib-big,
I could throw my arms round him.&nbsp; Dear hippop-pop-pop-pop-otamoms!</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Oh, look! there is that gentleman who got into the
train with you on the blessed day that we first met.&nbsp; Mr Flamm,
I think Mr Gresham said his name was.</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> Flamm.</p>
<p><i>Flamm</i>.&nbsp; Ah, Plumper, how are you, old man?&nbsp; I was
looking for you everywhere.&nbsp; Why, what have you done with Mrs Plumper
and the children?</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; My mother and her little grandchildren, you mean.&nbsp;
I was not aware that they were to come here to-day.</p>
<p><i>Fl</i>.&nbsp; Your mother! and grandchildren!&nbsp; Why, what
the dev---&nbsp; Oh, ah, ahem!&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; I see&mdash;mum&rsquo;s
the word.&nbsp; Oh fie! sly dog!&nbsp; Naughty, naughty!&mdash;but so
nice!&nbsp; [<i>Whispers</i>.]&nbsp; You are quite safe with me.&nbsp;
[<i>Aloud</i>.]&nbsp; Yes, dear old lady&mdash;she&rsquo;s getting too
old to walk much now.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; I only hope we shan&rsquo;t
meet the young one.&nbsp; A jolly row there&rsquo;ll be!</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; I hope soon to have the pleasure of <!-- page 141--><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>being
introduced to Mr Plumper&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; I am sure I shall like
her.</p>
<p><i>Fl</i>.&nbsp; Oh, I am sure you will; she is the dearest, most
delightful old lady!&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; At least I hope she
is by this time, for she was a horrid old cat up to the day of her death,
ten years ago.&nbsp; By Jove! here come Mrs Plumper and the young uns.&nbsp;
Now for it!</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> Mrs Plumper.</p>
<p><i>Mrs Plumper</i>.&nbsp; Why, Adolphus, where have you been?&nbsp;
Excuse me, madam; I did not see that you were upon my husband&rsquo;s
arm.&nbsp; Perhaps he&rsquo;ll have the goodness to present his wife
to you.</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; His wife! her husband!&nbsp; [<i>Screams&mdash;faints</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Mrs P</i>.&nbsp; Yes, madam.&nbsp; You may well scream, &ldquo;His
wife! her husband!&rdquo; and then pretend to faint.&nbsp; Who else&rsquo;s
wife do you suppose I am?</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; I am sorry I have no time for explanation now, as
I must attend to this young lady; but if you will have the kindness
to hold my hat, Mr Flamm.&nbsp; [<i>Hands his hat to</i> Flamm.]&nbsp;
And you, madam, to take care of <!-- page 142--><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>these.&nbsp;
[<i>Takes off his wig and spectacles and hands them to</i> Mrs Plumper.]&nbsp;
Your own senses will explain a good deal.&nbsp; As you may have already
discovered, I am not Mr Plumper at all; in fact, I perceive him approaching.&nbsp;
Help me to hold her head a little higher, please Mr Flamm; and Mrs Plumper,
kindly undo the back of her dress, or her stays, or her <i>chiton</i>,
or whatever is underneath, and let go everything generally, so as to
give her a chance of breathing.</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> Plumper.</p>
<p><i>Fl</i>.&nbsp; Here, Plumper, you&rsquo;re a medical man, just
come in the nick of time.&nbsp; This gentleman here has been personating
you for some reason or other, and the discovery caused the young lady
to faint.&nbsp; Mysterious, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; Not at all, when you come to know the circumstances.&nbsp;
Here is my card; and you will find me ready to make any apology or offer
you any satisfaction you may require.&nbsp; Meantime, Dr Plumper, let
me implore you to assist me in bringing her to.</p>
<p><i>Pl</i>.&nbsp; There now, my gug-gug-good lady, take a smell of
this.&nbsp; There now, we are beginning to feel beb-beb-better already.&nbsp;
<!-- page 143--><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>[<i>Aside</i>.] Most
extraordinary coincidence, Flamm: this is the same lady and gentleman
we travelled up to town with a kuk-kuk-couple of months ago; and you
remarked upon our wonderful resemblance to each other.&nbsp; Horrid
bob-bob-bore, a fellow&rsquo;s being so like you; he can pip-pip-play
all sorts of tricks upon you.&nbsp; Just a chance he did not get me
into a did-did-devil of a scrape with Jemima.</p>
<p><i>Fl</i>. [<i>aside</i>].&nbsp; Well, you can always pay him off
in his own coin&mdash;that is, if you shave your head, and throw away
your spectacles, and give up stammering.</p>
<p><i>Pl</i>. [<i>aside</i>].&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t&mdash;that&rsquo;s
where he has the pup-pup-pull over me.&nbsp; [<i>Aloud</i>.]&nbsp; There
now, one or two bib-bib-breaths, and we are all right.&nbsp; Now, dud-dud-don&rsquo;t
go off again; it can be all satisfactorily explained.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp;
Hang me if I know how!</p>
<p><i>El</i>. [<i>opens her eyes while</i> Plumper <i>is bending over
her&mdash;screams</i>].&nbsp; Oh, Adolphus!&mdash;[<i>shuts them again</i>]</p>
<p><i>Pl</i>.&nbsp; There, there, my gug-gug-good lady, I&rsquo;m not
Adolphus; at least I am Adolphus, bub-bub-but not your Adolphus.&nbsp;
Here, Mr Gresham, if you&rsquo;re her Ad-dod-dod-dod-ol-phus, you&rsquo;d
better take her.</p>
<p><!-- page 144--><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span><i>El</i>. [<i>opens
her eyes, sees</i> Adolphus <i>bending over her&mdash;screams</i>].&nbsp;
Oh, where am I?&mdash;[<i>shuts them again</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Pl</i>.&nbsp; In the arms of your Adolphus.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
bub-bub-both Adolphuses.&nbsp; I suppose, if you&rsquo;ll rouse yourself
a little, you&rsquo;ll soon fif-fif-find out which is the right one.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; Lady Elaine, pardon me, and I will explain all.&nbsp;
I am Adolphus Gresham.&nbsp; I came back from Naples a month ago, and
have deceived you by disguising myself as Dr Plumper.&nbsp; I shall
never forgive myself unless you forgive me.</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Oh, this is too horrible!&nbsp; [<i>Shrinks from
him, and bursts into a violent fit of weeping</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Pl</i>.&nbsp; There, that&rsquo;s capital!&nbsp; Nothing like
a hearty fit of tears to kuk-kuk-comfort a woman when she finds herself
in a mess.&nbsp; Now Flamm, if you call a kuk-kuk-cab, we&rsquo;ll put
her in and send her home.</p>
<p>[<i>Exit</i> Flamm.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ll have the kindness, Dr Plumper, to
give me your address, and allow me to call upon you to-morrow, I think
I shall be able to give both Mrs Plumper and yourself a complete explanation
of what must appear most extraordinary conduct on my part.</p>
<p><!-- page 145--><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span><i>Re-enter</i>
Flamm.</p>
<p><i>Fl</i>.&nbsp; The cab is ready.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; Now, Lady Elaine, if you will allow Dr Plumper and
myself to assist you, we will accompany you home.&nbsp; [<i>Exeunt omnes</i>.</p>
<h3>Scene VI.&mdash;Lady Gules&rsquo;s Boudoir.&nbsp; Lord and Lady
Gules&mdash;Adolphus.</h3>
<p><i>Lord G</i>.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!&nbsp; Oh, wait a moment, my dear
Gresham, or you&rsquo;ll kill me with laughing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the
best joke I ever heard in my life, and most cleverly executed.&nbsp;
So you caught the Radical, Comtist, &aelig;sthetic little minx in her
own trap.&nbsp; Oh, excellent!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say how thoroughly
Lady Gules and I congratulate you on the success of your ruse, and how
happy you have made us.&nbsp; My lady there is too pleased with the
probable result to quarrel about the means.&nbsp; But how you did take
us all in!&nbsp; I give you my word I never suspected you for a moment.&nbsp;
Your stammer and wig were both admirable.&nbsp; As for Elaine, she&rsquo;s
torturing her brain with metaphysical doubts as to the nature of love,
and says she will never love again.&nbsp; She tells <!-- page 146--><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>her
mother that her Adolphus was an ideal personage who has no longer existence,
and that her love is buried with him; but here she comes, so we will
leave you to fight your own battle.</p>
<p>[<i>Exeunt</i> Lord <i>and</i> Lady Gules.</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> Elaine.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; Dear Elaine.</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Sir!</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; Nay, rather Adolphus than sir.</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; How can I say Adolphus? there is no Adolphus.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; Indeed there is&mdash;[<i>producing wig and spectacles</i>]&mdash;pup-pup-pardon
me while I put them on.&nbsp; If it was only my wig and spectacles you
cared about, did-did-dearest, I will wear them and stammer through life
fuf-fuf-for your sake.</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Oh, Mr Gresham, how can you be so heartless?&nbsp;
You know very well I loved you&mdash;at least I didn&rsquo;t love you,&mdash;I
mean, I thought I loved Adolphus&mdash;at least I was sure of it at
the time; but I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t now.&nbsp; Oh, how cruel
of you!</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; But if it was not my wig and spectacles and stammer
for which you felt a magnetic <!-- page 147--><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>affinity,
I want to know exactly what it was you did love; because I am precisely
the same human being without them as with them.&nbsp; What about me
struck that mysterious chord of sympathy which vibrated in your affections
when I was Plumper, which failed to strike it as Gresham?&nbsp; Why
should not our hearts still beat in sweet accord without my wig?&nbsp;
Why should not &ldquo;this exquisite garment, which we have both worn&mdash;[<i>takes
up the dress, which is lying on a chair in the corner</i>]&mdash;be
the symbol of that internal robe which costumes our united souls, woven
from the texture of our affections,&rdquo; without my spectacles?</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Mr Gresham, how dare you talk such nonsense?&nbsp;
The texture of our affections indeed! mine are dead&mdash;basely, foully
murdered.&nbsp; Oh, was ever woman so cruelly humiliated?</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; Nay, Elaine, I merely wished to prove to you that
your aversion for me was entirely unfounded.&nbsp; You have proved to
me that your love for Adolphus, in the abstract, is as baseless and
unsubstantial.&nbsp; I am not sorry under the circumstances that it
should have been murdered, for it was a poor exotic.&nbsp; Let <!-- page 148--><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>us
not attempt to analyse the mysterious nature of that passion which is
too precious a plant to tear up by the roots in order to discover the
origin of its existence, but learn rather from this lesson, so painful
to us both, that there are more things in heaven and earth than are
dreamt of even in the philosophy of Comte, the doctrines of the &aelig;sthete,
or the politics of Mr Gladstone.&nbsp; And now, Elaine, farewell,&mdash;this
time you need not fear my coming back from Naples.&nbsp; [<i>Moves towards
the door and lingers</i>.]</p>
<p>[Elaine <i>puts her face between her hands and sobs convulsively</i>.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; Elaine, dear Elaine [<i>returns softly and takes
her hand</i>], do you wish me to go?</p>
<p>[Elaine <i>shakes her head</i>.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; Do you wish me to stay?</p>
<p>[Elaine <i>shakes her head</i>.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; What do you wish me to do?&nbsp; I must do either
one or the other.&nbsp; Shall I stay and go alternately, or shall we
make a fresh start, without prejudice, as the lawyers say?</p>
<p><i>El</i>.&nbsp; Oh, how heartlessly you talk!&nbsp; What do I care
what the lawyers say?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you see how miserable I am,
and how hollow everything seems all at once?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe
<!-- page 149--><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>in any one, and I
don&rsquo;t feel as if I knew anything, except that love is an inexplicable
phenomenon of matter.&nbsp; I shall become an agnostic.</p>
<p><i>Re-enter</i> Lord <i>and</i> Lady Gules.</p>
<p><i>Lord G</i>.&nbsp; Well, have you two young people come to an understanding?&nbsp;
Take my word for it, Elaine, an ounce of practice is worth a pound of
theory in love-affairs, and be thankful if the man is willing to become
your husband, who has had sufficient common-sense to teach you the lesson.&nbsp;
Holloa! whom have we here?</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> Charles <i>with cards</i>.</p>
<p><i>Lord G</i>. [<i>reads</i>].&nbsp; &ldquo;Dr and Mrs Plumper and
Mr Flamm, to inquire for Lady Elaine Bendore.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oho! our
friend Plumper seems to know the difference between theory and practice
at any rate, and is evidently anxious to extend the latter.&nbsp; [<i>To</i>
Charles.]&nbsp; Show them up.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; I called upon the Plumpers this morning, and explained
the whole affair to the entire satisfaction of the worthy couple.</p>
<p>[Adolphus <i>and</i> Lady Elaine <i>whisper apart</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 150--><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span><i>Lord G</i>.&nbsp;
I have to thank you, Dr Plumper, for the timely assistance you rendered
my daughter&mdash;first, in nearly sending her into a fit, and then
in bringing her out of it; and am glad of this opportunity of expressing
my sense of the obligation I am under to Mrs Plumper and Mr Flamm.</p>
<p><i>Dr P</i>.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t mention it, my lord; I am sure
I was only too gug-gug-glad to be of any assistance to Mr Gresham by
being so like him as to frighten the young lady into a fif-fif-fit.&nbsp;
And as for bringing her to&mdash;I always take the sal-volatile in my
pup-pup-pup-pocket on Mrs Plumper&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p><i>Ad</i>.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ll accept me, Elaine, as your husband,
even though I don&rsquo;t abandon my political aspirations, or introduce
&aelig;sthetic principles into <i>Kindergartens</i>, or adopt the philosophy
of Comte?</p>

have convinced me that the loftiest of all aspirations, the purest of
all principles, the supremest of all philosophies, is&mdash;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
